========
04.02.01 ::> Downloaded and Installed SMAUG 1.4a
======== ::> Yeah! Compile errors!
         ::> "Not wanting to deal with MUD" time.
         ::> Fixed Compile errors.
         ::> Run MUD for the first time.
         ::> Fixed PC save "bug".

========
04.03.01 ::> Cleared out stock races and classes.
======== ::> "Removed" class system.
         ::> NEW RACE - Basic Saiyan information.
         ::> Changed SCORE format.
         ::> All races have been setup with their basic info.
========
04.09.01 ::> Got the auth system working. (I didn't want to use mpapply)
======== ::> Got the save system working. (you can save now if your authed)
         ::> Attack Modifier implemented. (needed for PL conversion)
         ::> All major references to exp have been changed to PL.
         ::> Removed movement system and used "max_move" for "current PL".
         ::> Finally finished the conversion from Exp level to Powerlevel .
         ::> Found out that a divide by zero error crashes the mud. So I
                had to set the default PL of mobs to 1 so a builder who wasn't
                thinking wouldn't kill the mud.
         ::> Reformatted the prompt so it displays the "real" information.
         ::> Got lifeforce working as a percent of your total HP.
         ::> Removed hunger and thirst code because it annoys me.
         ::> I think armor will work by preventing a % of damage, but I can't
                test it because mobs can't seem to hit PC's...
         ::> The races can now use their languages.
========
04.10.01 ::> Fixed bug in gain_exp().  now PC's won't gain 169,084,960 PL every
========        every time they kill a mob.
         ::> attmod = (float) (PL1 / PL2) doesn't really work does it?  Fixed
                that syntax and now the fighting system works with PL's! (Was
                having problems with who ever had the higher PL, even by 1
                point, the lower PL person (mob or pc) would always miss the
                other guy)
         ::> Armor now prevents damage done to you. (tested it and it works!)
         ::> Added "train" code. Now you can train your stats higher. I haven't
                tested it yet because I've got more important stuff to do
                first.
         ::> Added grav training code.
========
04.11.01 ::> Removed almost all code referencing the old "AD&D" classes and
========        races. Only stuff in the spell.c and skill.c still reference the
                old guys, but I'll be wiping those files soon so I don't care.
         ::> Sweet! I figured out how to add new fields to the PFile with out
                screwing up the mud.  I added PL, MaxPrac, Train, MaxTrain
                fields. Now current PL is linked to PL and not Max_Move, and
                your training points are linked to Train and not Move.
         ::> "Levels" are now set up so you can gain energy, pracs and trains
                when your pl gets to certain levels.
========
04.12.01 ::> Immortals can now "die" just like normal PC's.  The only difference
========        is that imms don't leave corpses.
         ::> All PC's have the dodge and anticipate attack skills. Dodge is
                affected by your dex and anticipate is affected by your int.
         ::> Increased bare hand damage to 2d4 (it was 1d4) it was taking to
                damn long to kill mobs.
         ::> Lowered starting stats from 13 to 5 and gave all races str as
                their prime attribute so str will start at 8.
         ::> Installed a color patch.  Now color's display properly.
         ::> Increased the maximum vnums allowed from 32k to 2bil.
========
04.13.01 ::> Added "GODSET" command because I needed more admin power then
========        "MSET" had.  I will also be adding "GODSTAT" soon.
         ::> Fixed up the "SCORE" command.  I will be adding color to it in the
                next few days.
========
04.17.01 ::> I got practicing working they way I want it to (so imms can't learn
========        everything)
         ::> Added SSJ, SSJ2, SSJ3, and SSJ4 skills!

         ::> Added color to the "SCORE" command.
         ::> Set up when PC's gain energy, trains and practices to reasonable
                values.
         ::> I've got practices working even closer to the way I want them to
                work.  Just a few more hours...
========
04.23.01 ::> Added "OOC" channel for non-role-playing chat.
======== ::> Made the "CHAT" and "OOC" channels colorful.
========
04.25.01 ::> Fixed a small bug with practice points.
======== ::> Lot's of help file editing.
         ::> Added color to the ANSI login screen.
========
04.26.01 ::> Added descriptions to players that are powered up with kaioken,
========        ssj, super namek, and icer transforms.
========
04.29.01 ::> Powerlevel's are now using 'long doubles' instead of 'ints'.
======== ::> More tweaks to the fighting system.
         ::> Fixed some problems with high PL fighters attacking low PL
                fighters.
========
04.30.01 ::> Added num_punct_ld() so all the powerlevel displays won't be so
========        hard to read.
         ::> Finally have skills and abilities working exactly how I want them
                to.
         ::> Fixed a crash bug.  If you tried to practice a skill or ability
                that didn't exist while you were in the presence of a teacher,
                the mud crashes.
