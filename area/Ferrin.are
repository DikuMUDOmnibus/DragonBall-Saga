The Entrance of Capsule Corporation~
 This is the entrance of the Capsule Corporation main building.  Known
for its advanced technology and genius cadre of workers, it's a place of
great pride to most of West City's inhabitants.  Commonly filled with
visitors, the main hallway entrance is decorated, though simply.  The
occasional painting hangs on plastered walls, with a red carpet leading
deeper into the building covering the hard marble floor.  The ceiling is
dotted regularly with lights keeping the building at a comfortable level of
illumination.

The Capsule Corporation Entrance Hallway~
 Farther ahead is the main lobby of Capsule Corp.  As it is, you stand a
little farther in from the entrance.  Except for the placement of two doors
in this room, the hall has been a long, monothematic walk so far. The same
cold emptiness of the building continues, though you can hear the warmer
sounds of talking and the telltale sounds of invention in progress coming
from deeper inside the building.

Professor Briefs' Original Workshop~
 This tidy little room is well kept, for it is in fact the birthplace of
what is now Capsule Corporation.  The workshop where the Professor began
all of his studies, it has been kept in perfect condition as a memento.  A
small cleaner bot wheels itself around making sure everything is perfect
and not a speck of dust is on the plain white desk or small bookcase. 
Besides those objects, there is only a chair and small lamp in this room.

The Janitor's Closet~
 Back when Professor Briefs' workshop was a tiny little thing, he had a
janitor come in once a week and clean up for him.  The closet has been
preseved as well as his could be, with a small cleaning bot roving around
to take care of dust or any other problems with the small collection of
mops, buckets, and brooms this room contains.  The shelves are spotless,
each still with half-full containers of the cleaning supplies the janitor
used.  It's a simple room built for a simple man.

The Capsule Corporation Lobby~
 Here is where the hustle and bustle are most evident.  Men and women
in lab coats are everywhere around here, some walking from one place
to another, others racing to or from something you'll probably never
know of.  Almost opposite of the empty hallway leading to here, this
room is a hub of social activity.  A line of lights dots the ceiling
leading farther along to the center of the lobby.

The Capsule Corporation Lobby~
 The eastern side of the lobby seems to be a cacaphony of confusion.
A constant stream of scientists and other workers flows in and out of
the double doors leading to the workshops and laboratories.  Most seem
too busy to notice anything at all, their minds lost in their work and
planning.  Behind these doors is a world of infinate possibility and
proof that the powers of imagination and ingenuity can truly create
anything they wish to.

The Capsule Corporation Lobby~
 The northern end of the lobby sees a bit less traffic than the rest.
A few of the scientists around here tell some visitors that it's best
to try to avoid Dr. Briefs while he's in his lab, but it only dissuades
a few of them.  As far as you can tell, it looks the same as any other
part of the building, but scanning down the hallway to the north, you
see the large steel doors to his lab are tightly closed.

The Capsule Corporation Lobby~
 Though the West Wing of Capsule Corporation is basically off limits
to visitors, the doors are wide open and the scent of a nice breeze
can be smelled coming from down the hallway.  Few scientists are either
coming or going from this direction, but by all seemings, you're free
to head that way if you wish.

 The center of the Capsule Corporation lobby is marked by the large,
semi-circular desk of Matilda, the receptionist.  A hemispherical light
is in the ceiling directly over her chair, the light which the others
in the ceiling lead from.  Here to answer all questions for visitors
and new employees, Matilda has taken care to keep her area immaculate
and spotless.

 The dotted lights expand into much larger rings in the ceiling here,
giving a warm glow through the length of the hallway leading into the
Research and Development Wing of Capsule Corporation.  Frequented by
scientist and sightseer alike, the R & D wing is assumed safe by most
of Capsule Corporation, and visitors are always welcome to look, but
warned against getting too close to any of the projects.

The Hallway of Hopes and Progress~
 Framed and mounted, hung and photographed, here are the memories and
accomplishments of Capsule Corporation through the years.  Few of the
scientists notice this part of the walk anymore, but many first timers
can't help be stand in awe of the history of progression of the once
small, uninteresting building that became a worldwide technological
empire.  Photographs of Dr. Briefs giving his daughter her first tool
kit hang next to the case his own is mounted in.  A trail of hope and
dreams come to life, this hallway is one that Capsule Corporation is
very well known for.

The Hallway of Hopes and Progress~
 As the hallway stretches on, so do the sentimental treasures of the
building and its inhabitants.  From Bulma's first working machine to
the remains of Android 16's chest bomb, hardly anything from the ages
of Capsule Corporation is missing from this hall.  To call it amazing
would be calling the sun a spark.  It is truly marvelous to behold, and
many visitors moving on are left with a sense of awe long afterwards.

Divided Paths~
 As the Hallway of Hopes ends, the hallway itself branches.  A sign
on the wall ahead states that the North Wing is Matter Displacement
and that the South Wing leads to Cellular Reconstruction.  Scientists
flow freely to and from each path, so the choice is up to you.  The
west hallway will lead out of the Research and Development Wing.

other than their immaculate cleanliness, little differentiates this hallway
from any other.

Matter Displacement - Space Stations~
 Like the rest of the rooms in this hall, the second sector of the
Matter Displacement Wing has exits to both the north and the south.
Clearly labeled on each door is a small sign, idendifying the northern
door as one leading to the Center of the Universe Space Station and
the southern door as a path to what they've called the Maverick Space
Station.  Again, as you stand pondering which way to go, you can't help
but admire the detail to perfection that each inch of this metallic
hallway is composed of.  The walls and floors are smooth enough to
seem one piece of metal each, in fact!

Matter Displacement - Alien Worlds~
 Another stage in the hallway of Matter Displacement, this one seems
to have a less than balanced flow of traffic.  Very few of the scientists
running to and fro seem to enter the southern door, though many are
often seen heading in and out of the door to the north.  As you wonder
what this could mean, you see the tell-tale signs of where each leads.
To the north, Planet Namek.  To the south, though, the name of the planet
is left blank.  Strage...

 It seems this area of the Wing is under construction.  The doors to

people into new realms of the universe.  One would do good to check
back here someday...

avoid heading into the door to the north, though this room is as pristine
and clean as any other.

part of the Wing.  Strangely though, not many women are seen entering or
leaving the door to the south.

length of the hallway you see scientists rushing to and fro, from room to
room.  Some of them come out calling for comrades, some don't come out at
all.  It seems to be a very strange, yet very busy place this time of day.
Of course, Capsule Corporation is busy every time of day.

 So close to the bend leading towards the orange glow to the east, it

Perhaps the director is hoping to have at least a little bit of a good
impression on visitors, though exploring too much around here would most
likely shatter that impression rather quickly.

most likely sleeping off a long night's work.  The mess gets thicker here,
moreso than you could have ever imagined.  It seems half of all the technology
of Capsule Corp is thrown in this very spot.  And that's only the heap of
it that you're standing on at the moment.  What a mess.

about is only put there to allow ease of movement.  None of the scientists

means.

A Hallway to the Cellular Reconstruction Wing~
 The hallway leading to the southern part of the Research and Development
Wing is a mess.  Loose paper lies on the ground, scientists run around,
not even noticing the mess...parts of week old lunches still sit on the
carts around here!  Either the director is a very lazy person, or these
people have been too hard at work on this project to notice the mess.

Matter Displacement - Earth~
 The first branch of the Matter Displacement Wing has doors to both the
north and the south.  Clearly labeled on each door is a small sign, labeling
the north door South City and the south door Korin's Tower.  This entire hallway,
from ceiling to floor shines with the luster of polished, sterile, metal.
Apparently, the director of the Matter Displacement Wing runs a tight ship.

Northern Wing of R & D - Matter Displacement~
 The Northern Wing of Research and Development begins here.  Through the
length of the hallway you see scientists rushing to and fro, from room to
room.  Some of them come out calling for comrades, some don't come out at
all.  It seems to be a very strange, yet very busy place this time of day.
Of course, Capsule Corporation is busy every time of day.

Corporation all look the same.  Each houses a chamber large enough for
a few people to stand in, and each has a panel with instructions on how
to operate the chambers next to it.  Apparently, though, it's quite simple.
To use the displacement chambers, one has only to say he or she wishes to
be transported.

 Two small openings in the wall at this point of the walk house the

they are ever actually near this small area, it's still a bit interesting
becuase when you look at the spot in the wall they fit into, you notice
that had they been in there places, you wouldn't be able to tell them
from the rest of the wall.  As you innocently admire the craftsmanship
of the building, a strange sound is heard to the north, followed by a
quick flash of red light and a scream!

hinting to a bathroom in the back.  It's no wonder Dr. Briefs is rarely
seen outside of his lab...he has everything he could ever need right here

the area.  Strange that Dr. Briefs wouldn't have had the cleaner bots
take care of this yet.  Perhaps he just likes holding on to old ideas.

And though the cleaner bots do a good job at what they do, there's no way
they could have fluffed the furniture to show such a lack of use.  Apparently
Dr. Briefs doesn't entertain much company.

 Continuing lack of carpet along the eastern wall gives rise to the
idea that this is an area where dropping things happens alot.  This
small area, though, houses Dr. Briefs' computer and rolling chair.
Why there wouldn't be carpet here seems a bit strange to you, until
you see the large pile of jelly donuts on the floor next to the chair
and the massive sippy cup of coffee he needs to make it through the
long nights.  Apparently, Dr. Briefs, genius that he is, hasn't really
discovered how unhealthy his diet is.

in the building, and he seems to enjoy his job.  The 'Smite' button
just under the monitor showing the hallway outside his lab is almost
worn down to the keyboard as often as he's pressed it.  Apparently
even the sanest of scientists are a touch mad...or maybe they just
enjoy their job.

with a lamp and nightstand next to it makes for a cozy nights rest
after a long day's work.  From the look of the sheets though, it doesn't
wind up getting much use.  It looks like its never been slept in at all.

what you may have thought.  File cabinets and shelves upon shelves take
up almost every bit of spare room in this area, and the carpeted floor
is worn threadbare from pacing.  Wrapped up in his work, it seems Dr.
Briefs hasn't even noticed you coming in.

 The hallway is unnecessarily wide at this point, allowing almost a half
dozen people to walk comfortably wherever they wish.  However, this part
of the hallway is usually attended to by two large cyborgs, guardians of
the west wing.  It's a place you should either walk lightly in when they're
around or try to rush through.  But they're probably here to keep people
from going in for a reason, right?

To the south, though, is a door leading outside by the looks of it.

Exit of the West Wing~
 Well this is it.  Capsule Corporation's only other exit.  It's strange,
but you don't quite feel like you'll be welcome here.  It's a small,
simple door that's open freely with sounds of frivolity flowing in from
outside.  Of course, you can always head back to the north for some more
looking around the Corporation.

Stepping Out~
 You're standing on a small stone path leading out of the building.
Further ahead, some people are lounging and enjoying the weather.
There isn't really anything that stands out about this area, but while
standing here enjoying the weather, you're narrowly missed by the
droppings of some bird far, far above.  Gross.

Walkway to the Promenade~
 The stone walkway ends here at the beginning of a large, round patio,
a Promenade of sorts.  It seems a friendly, inviting place.  No matter
how bad the weather, or what time of night, these people seem to be
out here, doing the same things they're always doing.

A Small Promenade~
 At this edge of the patio, Bulma's mom is greeting everyone and everything
that is within sight of her and probably a few things that only she can see.
Either way, she's the kind of person that makes the day a little brighter and
food a little tastier than anyone else can.  Besides her, about the only thing
here are a few patio chairs around a table with an umbrella in it.

The West Wing~
 The lights flicker here, as if someone is either lax on the upkeep or
just wishing to drive away company.  Nonetheless, the hall continues to
the north and south, with the south being a much brighter, cheerier place.

The West Wing~
 Nearing the end of this hallway, a rancid, metallic stench is starting
to tickle your nose.  It doesn't smell like blood, but it seems to be
coming from beyond the door to the north.  Perhaps you should stick with
the advice of the employees and stay away from this area...?

Entrance to the Basement~
 All there is to this small, simple room is a staircase leading down to
a deeper part of the building and the same door you came through to get
here.  The plaster is peeling, the floor is rotted...it is definately
not a pretty picture.

 Piles of broken machines and rejected inventions lay strewn about here.
Apparently, when Capsule Corporation wants to remove something from sight
and not quite get rid of it, they store it down here.  Some of the bits
and pieces have been corroded completely through, while others shine as
if they had been polished moments ago.  Truly, this is a creepy place.

Capsule Corporation's Basement~
 Occasionally called the "Oil Room," this part of the basement's floor
curves inward a bit, letting the runoff of the other rooms collect into
one greasy, disgusting mess here.  The cleaner bots won't go down this
far, so this room has been drawing in more and more heavy liquid over
the course of the many years its been here.

 Besides the gross amounts of junk and inventions laying here and there,
this room has a thin, rusty ladder protruding from the floor that leads
deeper into this reeking, hellish pit of inspiration's nightmare.  Further
on to the south is yet another room, though you can't tell what's in it
from here.

 The Mechacombs, as they are called by the employees unfortunate enough
to wind up down here, are nothing more than dumping grounds.  To call
this place the equivalent of a dump would be to call the sun a candle.
Broken bodies of androids, hollowed shells of devices, and the horrible

The Nightmare~
The Nightmare seems endless.  Shattered husks of failed androids lie
lifelessly among mundane sheet metal and machines whose uses could only
be guessed.  Through it all, a dim shower of sparks comes from the
horizon, lighting the way for visitors and giving life to the Nightmare.

The Forgotten Room~
 The Nightmare stops.  It doesn't decline, it doesn't relent, it just
stops.  At the end of it, though, is a sight far more horrific than
any part of what you've come through.  This is the place of the Great
Machine.  Lifeless bodies of visitors and scientists alike are here,
killed by the heartless machine that was built to do nothing else.

The Scrapyard~
 If what you walked through before was a Nightmare, this is a cold chill.
Small piles of scrap and dead machinery lie everywhere.  As if a calm
after a storm, this place is eerily quiet.

A Small Promenade~
 This small, shaded part of the promenade is where Krillin's family
likes to relax.  His daughter's toys lie strewn about and his wife
stands dispassionately to the side.  On occasion, though she gives
her daughter a quiet smile.  They're the ideal image of the perfect
family...well, as perfect as one can be with a half-android daughter!

 This peaceful corner of the promenade is where Yamcha comes to relax.
Next to his usual seat rests a badmiton racket, though it doesn't seem
to get any more play than he does these days. This is a small, shaded
portion of of the patio, and seems to have enough room to comfortably
stretch out...or make trouble.

Cellular Reconstruction Level 3~
 As heaped up as the garbage is in the middle of this hallway, it's the
smell of this particular area that's truly stomach turning.  Week old
fish left in the sun and soaked in vomit is the kind of smell this place
might had had two years ago.  You can't help it...the smell overpowers
you and you retch, adding to the mess around you.

Cellular Reconstruction Level 3 - Multi-Specialized Saiyan~
 Each room of the Cellular Reconstruction area is identical.  Or rather,
each room started that way.  As it is, various clutter lies strewn about
and the entire area is in a general disarray.  The one thing that each
room does share though, is a large cylinder in the middle of the room.

A Warm, Bright Hallway~
 Simply put, this is a long hallway that emenates a soft orange glow.
The light seems to come from all around at once, though nothing but the
metal of the walls, floor, and ceiling could possibly be giving it off.
Strange as it is, you feel a warmth enter your body, relaxing your mind
and refreshing your body.

Matter Displacement - Under Construction~
 It seems this area of the Wing is under construction.  The doors to
the north and south are closed off, and sounds of labor can be heard
coming from each.  Capsule Corporation must be preparing to send more
people into new realms of the universe.  One would do good to check
back here someday...

A Hallway to the Cellular Reconstruction Wing~
 The hallway leading to the southern part of the Research and Development
Wing is a mess.  Loose paper lies on the ground, scientists run around,
not even noticing the mess...parts of week old lunches still sit on the
carts around here!  Either the director is a very lazy person, or these
people have been too hard at work on this project to notice the mess.

The Capsule Corporation Gravity Pod~
 This big, round room is usually occupied by one person and one person
alone, Vegeta, the Prince of the Saiyan Race. The gravity in the room
is oppressive, even to the hardiest of warriors and there isn't a sign
of food or a place to rest anywhere. Each second that passes feels like
its taken a week to do...every part of this room is stress on one part
of the body or another.

A Small Promenade~
 Usually free of people, this part of the patio is a bit less well-kept
than the rest. What stands out the most, though, is the walkway to the
west leading up and into Vegeta's training pod. It would take either a
great warrior or a great fool to interrupt him during training, as shown
and evidenced by the small flecks of dried blood that the cleaning bots
couldn't quite scrub up from the last person that bothered him.

A Small Promenade~
 A large jungle gym takes up most of this area. Gotenks and Trunks are
often seen playing on and around it, but only when they don't have any
other trouble to get into. The brightest part of the Promenade, it's
usually littered with toys and any other mess kids can get into, but
looks pretty clean today.

 Completely spotless and pure, the Matter Displacement rooms in Capsule
Corporation all look the same.  Each houses a chamber large enough for
a few people to stand in, and each has a panel with instructions on how
to operate the chambers next to it.  Apparently, though, it's quite simple.
To use the displacement chambers, one has only to say he or she wishes to
be transported.
