A winged, cyclopean droid~
A giant, winged robot flies here, searching for escaped prisoners
~
This giant robot stands at least nine feet tall, with one pulsing, red,
electronic eye set in the middle of its head.  Its arms end in four
pincers, and it's body seems to be constructed from super strong materials.
This particular model has a pair of large wings, like something you'd see
on a jet plane, and a jet engine that enables it to soar through the skies
in pursuit of fleeing prisoners.

Metal Cooler~
Metal Cooler stands in the middle of the corridor, smirking
~
This is a standard model Metal Cooler that is mass produced by the Gete
Star.  It is modeled after, and controlled by, the Icer named Cooler.  The
shiny, smooth metal that makes up his body is formed from an unkown and
highly durable space-age alloy. Being made out of this metal and the Big
Gete Star's nanites, this creature can regenerate from almost any wound
instantly, even quickly recovering from what seems like death.

Wide Open Room~
This seems to simply be a wide open area, with no floor or ceiling. 
Below you is a shadowy pit, the bottom seeming to contain different types
of debris. Above you is what looks to be another open room, at the very top
of the Big Gete Star, with healing tanks welded to every wall.

in the southern wall. Suddenly it tears open, one of the little robots
zipping out of a small room to continue on its way.  What could this be?

move through the walls...energy flowing outwards from the heart of the Big
Gete Star.

Outside the Cells~
You are standing outside what looks like some sort of prison.  To the
north and south are holding cells, the barred doors looking rather
primitive.  The metal bars ripple with the now familiar sight of liquid
metal, a surge of electricty running through the bars a moment later. 
Things aren't as simple as they first appeared.

We interrupt your regularly scheduled description of a futuristic prison
to bring you this poem.  "The ends of forever locked in bars of light. 
There is no day, there is no night.  Stuck within these walls.  Echoing
down the hollow halls.  You are made a prisoner of it all." As you return
to your surroundings...the cell you currently find yourself in is packed
with Namekian prisoners.  They seem to have lost all hope, simply standing
in the cramped room.  They know what awaits them, they can hear the
screams...

drain that takes it away to the energy collection centers.

This neglected cranny of the Big Gete Star seems to have fallen into
disrepair. A red, cybernetic eye is mounted on the wall, with a giant crack
down the middle.  It throws off sparks and produces weak, strained noises

the dead end, finding no spare materials to use for repair.

This seems to be the sickbay of some long dead spaceship, absorbed and
modified for the Big Gete Star's uses.  Healing tanks line the walls, a few
already filled with vaugely humanoid shapes. You can look down and see the
room below, that you flew up from to get here, as this particular area
lacks a floor.  Further below is the shadowy pit. The walls the tanks are
attached to seem to be much more liquid than most sections of this
monstrous planet.  The metal shifts and ripples over every surface, a large
patch of the ceiling twitching offbeat.  Another red, silent, electronic
eye sits on a wall, calmly watching the inhabitants of this open air room.

All this noise comes from the east, the cells to the north and south much

Corridor~
This corridor seems little used and neglected...by living beings, at
least.  Sparking wires hang down from spots in the ceiling where the
patchwork of scrap metal is incomplete. On parts of the wall where the
liquid metal coating has somehow been peeled away, bare circuitry is
exposed.

covered by this living metal reveal an impossibly complex mass of thin
wires that crackle and pop with the flow of electric power, sparks
sometimes jumping out and fading before they reach the ground.

The walls in this corridor fade from frigid purple into a familiar,

merely a slot in the wall next to it for a keycard to be inserted.  Below
this are a few buttons, that might assist in opening the unlocked door. 
Could this be the center, the heart of the Big Gete Star?  The walls pulse
with life, a soft glow seeping out from the edges of this final door.

This room sits in the very center, the core of the computerized
planetoid you have journeyed through.  Like the other rooms, its walls are
composed of shifting metal and crackling circuits.  However, in the middle
there is a large pillar with one side opened up.  Inside you spot what
seems to be the remains of an Icer, partially covered in more of the
shifting metal.

The cell you currently find yourself in is packed with Namekian
prisoners.  They simply stand around, looking completely drained of hope

shock any prisoners who get too close.  The walls seem to be trying to

The walls of this cell are barren, the only light coming from a red lens

prisoners who have tried to somehow dig their way out, to no avail.  Having
given up hope, the Nameks simply stand around the cell, waiting.  They know
what is going on so near them, they can hear the screams...and they know
they will be next.

The moment you enter this room, your senses are assaulted by the

smeared and splattered over most every surface, along with bits of other
gore.  It drips off of four slender metal arms which end in large, sharp
sawblades.  The saws are currently busy dicing a still struggling Namek
into easily digestable pieces.  The screams are even worse than the mess.

You are standing outside what looks like some sort of prison.  To the
north and south are holding cells, the barred doors looking rather
primitive.  The metal bars ripple with the now familiar sight of liquid
metal, a surge of electricty running through the bars a moment later. 
Things aren't as simple as they first appeared.

Holding Cell~
The walls of this cell are barren, the only light coming from a red lens
pulsing warmly in the ceiling.  The floor is scarred with the scratches of
prisoners who have tried to somehow dig their way out, to no avail. Having
given up hope, the Nameks simply stand around in the cell, awaiting what
seems to be the end.

Holding Cell~
This cell seems to be in rather bad shape.  Parts of the wall are ripped
off, bare wires dangling out to shock any prisoners who get too close. The
walls seem to be trying to repair themselves, though the bars of the cell
door are in perfect condition.  All the Nameks that are locked up seem
content to wait, silently, in the middle of the holding cell.

Grinders~
Entering this room, a horrific scene is laid out for you inside.  The
putrid smell of fresh and old blood, smeared and splattered over most every
surface. Huge things that look like gears are busy smashing a few young
Nameks into green and purple paste.  The mess splashes off, oozing into a
drain that takes it away to the energy collection centers.

Near the Northern Entrance~
This corridor seems little used and neglected...by living beings, at
least.  Sparking wires hang down from spots in the ceiling where the
patchwork of scrap metal is incomplete. On parts of the wall where the
liquid metal coating has somehow been peeled away, bare circuitry is
exposed.

Northern Exit~
A red, cybernetic eye is mounted on either side of the entrance
corridor.  They both seem to stare straight at you, watching you venture
into the Big Gete Star.  A soft beep emits from one, followed by a second
from the other eye, before they both grow suddenly brighter...

Energy Collection Center~
This room is naturally dark, the only thing visible without some sort of
light are some glowing tubes attached to the strangely calm walls.  They
seem to contain mostly purple fluid, that is being pumped directly into
this Big Gete Star. Something about this process seems to promote rapid
recovery, almost as if the entire room were a healing tank.  This seems
like a good place to rest, but it's doubtful that any part of this
monstrous planetoid is really safe.

Pit~
Piles of refuse has built up at the bottom of this dark pit, containing
most anything the monstrous orb cannot properly digest or use.  Various
parts of robots, spaceships, rocks, and waste take up space in this deep
pocket. Climbing out doesn't seem to be an option, as the sides are coated
in oil and grease.

Above the Top of the Big Gete Star.~
You've finally reached the very top of this monster planetoid.  Like the
rest of this orb, the top is covered in shifting, living metal.  Faint
noises seem to come from below.  Sounds of life, flickers of movement
beneath the hull of the ship.  Perhaps if you stopped flying and landed on
the hull, both feet on the ground, you could get a closer look?

orb is simply massive, taking up most of this huge plain.  Up here it seems
motionless, even lifeless, if not for the distant moving dots that are the
Nameks being led to their doom by the cyclopean drones.

Nothing obstructs your seemingly endless view of that around you, save

planet apart.  Devouring it, and its helpless inhabitants.

From way up here, high above the Namekian plains, you can get a better

from the main body of the Big Gete Star are moving, shifting slightly.
They're slowly spreading outwards, digging themselves deeper into the
planet.  Rooting the giant sphere into Namek.

Flying Nimbus~
A cloud is parked here, slightly different from all the others you've
seen floating through this sky.  This one is orangish, and seems to be
rather firm.  In fact, you think you'd be able to land upon it quite
easily. It's also wide enough to fit at least two people, and seems perfect
for a quick spar before entering the murderous deathtrap nearby.

sea of liquid metal.  Why has it landed here, on Namek?  The silent
guardians that walk the ground and fly the skies around you have no answer.

Suddenly the winds seem to rise and swirl around you, as battles flare

atrocities and horrors are occurring every second. It smells like fire, it
looks like rain...what is going on here?  What is this monster planet doing
to peaceful Namek?

Down below, Nameks are being guided toward the main body of the Big Gete
Star. You watch a bold young Namek break from the group and attack one of
the cyclopean droids. After his death, the line of Nameks resume their walk
towards the entrance of this massive orb.

The arm-like protrusions extending from the main body of the star are
moving and shifting slightly, slowly spreading themselves deeper into
Namek. Expanding, moving the ground as they anchro the orb firmly into the
planet.

Namekian Plains~
Up in the air, flashes of movement...green and grey, powered by jets and
ki energy.  Perhaps a few prisoners have managed to escape the clutches of
the Big Gete Star's cyclopean drones. What remains to be seen is, how long
can they elude the clutches of the monster planet resting so close to you.

Entrance to the Big Gete Star~
The main body of the Big Gete Star looms before you.  A living metal
mass bent on devouring this planet, its inhabitants, and everyone else for
power to fuel its evil ambition, for energy to sate its foul appetites. A
wide, jagged hole in the side of the structure swallows Namek after Namek
into its dark interior, led to the entrance by cyclopean guards.

Namekian Plains~
To every side, Nameks are being rounded up and dragged into the Big Gete
Star by cyclopean droids.  Up in the sky, there seems to be some sort of
movement.  A flash of green, followed quickly by a shining, metallic
figure. The liquid metal hull of this crashed giant ripples nearby, as if
trying to reach out and grasp the fleeing Namek.

The rippling, liquid metal hull of the menacing orb ripples nearby,
almost close enough to reach out and touch.  To every side, Nameks are
being rounded up and dragged towards Big Gete Star by cyclopean guards.

A line of chained Nameks can be seen here, drudging along toward the
waiting maw of the monster planet.  They plod forward helplessly, under the
cold and watchful cybernetic eyes of the huge robots.

Namekian Plains~
Their spirits broken by the overwhelming power of the red eyed drones,
chained Nameks continue past here without resistance into an opening in the
circuit coated hull of the Big Gete Star.  They must know that, inside,
only their demise awaits them.

Perhaps by ascending into the sky you would be better able to observe the
situation?  Though the skies seem just as 'friendly' as the ground.

Namekian Plains~
This is the edge of some massive, arm-like protrusion that extends out
of the Big Gete Star.  It blocks your way, and many other tendrils are
driven into the planet elsewhere.  Almost as if the metallic predator has
enclosed the planet Namek in a deadly embrace.
