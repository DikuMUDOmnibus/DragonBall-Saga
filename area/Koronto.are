looking curved stinger on the end of its tail. The color of its 
carapace is mostly red, with some mottled brown color mixed in.

A tiny scorpion~
A tiny scorpion scuttles around on the ground
~
This 9-inch long scorpion looks very fierce for its small size. It's
constantly scuttling about at a high speed, and the stinger on the tail
looks like it could delier some damage with ease.

large scorpion~
A large scorpion~
A large scorpion scuttles around on the ground
~
This monstrously large scorpion is the size of a dog. The dry, chitonous
shell makes a crackling and snapping noise as it moves around across the
desert floor. The main body of this scorpion is reddish with some green
stripes, while the legs and tail are solid blood-red.

giant scorpion~
A giant scorpion~
A giant scorpion is standing here.
~
This gigantic creature is almost as large as a dining room table! The
legs are like small tree trunks that move with sometimes blinding speed 
to propel the scorpion around at a high velocity. Most of the scorpion
is various shades of brown, save for the claws and tail, which are 
reddish, possibly with the stain of human blood.

mother scorpion~
A giant mother scorpion~
A bloated mother scorpion spews eggs onto the ground in a constant stream
~
This huge, bloated thing is hardly recognizable as a scorpion, although
upon inspection it clearly is. In front of the immense egg-sac is the bulky
body of a "normal" scorpion, if scorpions normally are the size of small
cars. It still has wicked claws and a vicious tail, but its legs are
atrophied to the point of uselessness. Occasionally one of them scrabbles
against the ground, but it does nothing to budge the massive bulk of the
scorpion from the ground.

An angry bandit~
An angry bandit storms around, furious!
~
This person, dressed in the brown shirt and baggy white pants of a
notorious group of bandits who live in the desert, is very angry at 
something. He's storming around gesticulating with his arms to himself,
and mumbling under his breath violently. His face is cherry red, all this
anger and stress must be very bad for his heart...

A grizzled bandit~
A grizzled veteran bandit stands here filled with quiet confidence.
~
This man is wearing a tight brown shirt and baggy white pants, the
trademark dress of a group of bandits in the desert. His unshaven face
is constantly scowling, and it looks like he might indeed have something
to scowl about. His face is covered in all sorts of scars, from a huge
one that goes from his chin to his left eyebrow, to many other tiny
scars only half and inch long, and everything in between. He's quite
old for a bandit, possibly in his 50's.

A fat bandit~
A fat bandit stands here unsteadily.
~
Most of the bandits in this desert wear a tight brown shirt and baggy
white pants. Well, this bandit's shirt is incredibly tight, and his pants
fit very well. That's because this bandit is a very large person. He
has a lot of musculature in some places, namely his arms, that make it
clear that this man is more adept at combat than a typical overweight
person.

~
This very short bandit doesn't seem to be too happy about his station
in life. He has a sort of depressed, sad look on his face, and his
clothes are that of the group of bandits that are in the desert. 
Regardless of him being short, he does look like he could hold his own in
a fight.

thick and muscular either. His long hair is light brown, and reaches to
below his shoulders.

The bandit chief~
The chief bandit stands here, grinning evilly.
~
The bandit chief is an overconfident, blustery fellow. He's grinning
and laughing constantly, but it's clear that there is some strength behind
his wall of bluff. He moves with the grace of a martial artist, and he
must have been strong enough to assume leadership of a pretty large group
of bandits. He's well muscled, but lithe and fast looking.

The bandit cook~
The bandit cook stands here flipping burgers.
~
The bandit cook sports an enourmous black moustache on his greasy upper
lip. He looks like a very poorly groomed man, and he's wearing a dirty
white apron and a classic chef's hat, albeit covered in grime. He's a
cheerful looking fellow, with creases at the edge of his mouth from years
of wide smiles. What he's doing in a camp of vicious bandits is not clear.

mutant coyote~
A mutant coyote~
A mutant coyote lopes around looking for prey.
~
Whether this pitiful creature is the result of scientific
experimentation or merely the result of mutation-causing pollutants dumped
in the wilderness is not clear.  What is clear is that this coyote is not
natural. It has festering open wounds all over its body that it seems to
ignore, and it also has several huge green growths on its back, sides, and
shoulders. The growths seem to pulsate and throb to some inner rhythm.  The
coyote's claws are long and curved, and drip with a strange black fluid. 
Its eyes are red and blootshot, and its pants expel a greyish green mist
into the air.

sand monster~
A sand monster~
A huge insectoid sand monster is partially buried under a pile of sand.
~
This bizarre beast is mostly concealed under a large pile of sand, but
what is visible looks large and mean. Seven huge tentacle-like legs
are sticking out of the ground. These legs are multi-jointed and very
flexible, capable of pointing in any direction. The tips of the legs
are equipped with a nastly looking needle-like spine. The sides of the
spine are transparent, and there's a glowing green liquid sloshing
around inside the spikes. Occasionally, in the center of the ring of
tentacles, a head or body is visible under the shifting sands, but
not long enough to get a good view.

Resting under a shady palm tree is this young man. He's enjoying the
cool shade and the view of the beatiful blue oasis. He's wearing a blue
shirt and khaki pants, and a white hat with a floppy brim. Anyone would
be tempted to sit next to him and enjoy the shade.

Inside a miniature sandstorm inside a pit, there is this tall humanoid
shape. It looks almost ten feet tall, and its body doesn't look like it's
proportioned quite right. The arms are too long, the legs are too short, 
and the torso is too high. No detail is visible because of the swirling
thick sand, but it definately does not look like a natural creature.

This shiny metal sphere is whizzing around through the air at a fair clip.
It's emitting a constant low buzzing sound. The main part of it is just
a simple sphere about a foot in radius. The surface is refelctive, but
it's pitted and corroded in parts, while other areas of its surface are
still shiny. Around the equator of the sphere are eight very sharp spikes
with what look like razor sharp edges.

there isn't a man visible in the room. On close examination, there is,

Koronto's hideout~
This room is located at the very top of a tower that is on the peak of
a tall mountain. Outside the barred windows, there is a perpetual heavy
black storm swirling around the tower. Inside, there's a huge desk with
tons of stuff on it, such as a very advanced looking quantum computer,
several unfinished woodworking projects, and many little miscellaneous
pieces of junk that have not been thrown away due to laziness. The walls
are covered in shelves filled with tools, computer parts, books, and
abstract sculptures.

The ground here is hard and dry. Some small plants manage to eke out
a living here, but there aren't many. Little of the desert to the west
can be seen, because the heat and glare of the sun blurs it. There are,
however, several huge rock outcroppings that are so large they can be seen

stone. South City is barely visible to the east.

Near giant rock~
The huge rock is just to the southeast. Right here, there are a ton of
small rocks on the ground, making it an interesting place to walk 
around. Tiny boulders jut up from the sand, and many more are buried
beneath.

Deep Desert~
Huge dunes lay all around in the deep desert, and there is hardly any
life to be seen anywhere. Beating down, the light of the sun is
incredibly sweltering and hot. There's nothing here, the desert is dull
and barren.

In The Desert~
This is part of a seemingly endless stretch of desert. It is smack dab
in the middle of absolutely nowhere, and there's nothing to see but
the sky, the sand, and mountains. The mountains are a nice sight, but
they do get old after a while.

North of the rock~

and it's a pleasant change from the immense heat of the sun beating down.
Small chunks occasionally fall from the top of the rock, which lists
slightly north.

Desert~
The sandy ground is grainy and unstable. To the northwest, the desert
stretches on for quite a way. Nothing relieves the barren monotony of
the desert itself, though. Big shifting sand dunes are almost all that 
marks terrain, except for a huge rock just to the southwest.

Near A Mountain Range~
The desert borders here on a high mountain range. It goes miles and miles
straight north from here. Some of the mountain peaks are very tall,
covered in ice year-round. The ice reflects the bright light of the sun
constantly, making it difficult to even look in the general direction of
the mountains without eye protection. There aren't many foothills or 
smaller mountains between the desert and the really high peaks, they just
stick straight out of the ground, which is pretty odd.

Dry Flats~
The center of a huge expanse of flat desert is not a very hospitable
place, which is most likely to be the reason why there are very few people
or other living things here.  It's almost totally empty, as if it were the
surface of the moon or an uninhabited planet.  There are a few landmarks
somewhat nearby, such as large rocks sticking out of the ground, and there
is a large mountain range just west of here, but that's it.

The Site of a Wreck~
Right smack dab in the middle of this huge empty desert plain, somebody
drove a car and wrecked it, somehow. There's a gutted carcass of what used
to be an automobile. It appears there was an explosion, because little bits
of warped shrapnel are scattered in a large radius around the wrecked car
itself. The car was very nice, an expensive luxury convertible, but it's not
worth anything anymore!

it a total wasteland, with no plants able to grow anywhere, and no variance
in the terrain. It's just flat for miles.

there are mountains west, desert north and south, and desert fading
into a grassland-ish area to the east. Just southwest of here the top of

is made of a dark brown wood and what looks like dried mud. There's a
4 foot high doorway with an animal skin of some kind hanging over the 
front of it. Scattered around the hut on the ground are several tiny
bones, that look like they come from some tiny animal.
There's a thick glass rod sticking out of the center of the top of the hut.
It catches the light of the sun well, and shines brightly.

Strange Rock Spires~
Here, in the center of a particularly featureless area of desert, a
totally flat plain without sand dunes and with solid ground, there is
an odd rock formation. About 20 tall rock spires are clustered together
in a group, like a grove of trees. The spires are jet black and jagged.
They twist around in strange contorted shapes and narrow to tiny points
at the tips. There is no clue whatsoever as to how they ended up here in
the desert or how they were formed.

Ancient Building~
There used to be a large building here, sometime in the past. It's been
abandoned to the desert long ago. The roof and most of two walls have
fallen in or been knocked down. Sand fills everything and piles up
against the exterior walls in huge piles. Most of what was the building
is currently under the sand, but it shifts around a lot. It might have been
a store, or some sort of commercial establishment, because there aren't
any things that would be indicative of it being a house. There are no beds
or dressers, but there are rotting file cabinets and a few desks. Anything
of value from the ruin has long been looted.

Mirage to the west?~
To the west is a bright shiny patch of what appears to be water! It could
be a mirage, however, or a heat-induced hallucination. The desert is very
hot and it often bakes people's brains. It could also be a desert mirage
caused by light being bent, but it does look like there are trees, as well!
It must be a real oasis! Unless it's hallucinatory...

Just to the southwest is an a picture perfect image of the typical
'desert oasis'. There is a large blue pond of clear, fresh water, 
surrounded by palm trees and lush green fronds. The oasis is surrounded by
flat yellow desert on all sides. The only thing different than the desert
in all directions is a mountain range to the west. Nothing else breaks

Water!~
The waters of the beautiful desert oasis gently lap at the shore with the
gentle wind. The water is a deep blue color reflected from the sky, and 
it's very clear. Bright green, healthy plants vie for space at the edge
of the oasis and for the water. A few frogs and fish can be seen through
the crystal clear water eating insects and swimming around. It is very
peaceful. The oasis is just to the west, and it's quite large.

swimming around in the shallows, and one occasionally leaps out to eat
an insect or other bit of food. The center of the oasis is a deep dark blue,

In the Middle of the Desert~
Inside the middle of the desert where there is neither shade nor shelter
from the sun and the ground is exposed al through the day to the bright
sunlight, it is almost impossibly hot.  This must be the location of some
of the hottest temperatures in the world!  The air around you seems to
sizzle and hiss with the intense temperature.  It's HOT!

In The Deep Desert~
This stretch of desert is much the same as any other. There are dunes
all around and the hot sun beats down nearly constantly. There happen to
be some strange discolorations in the sand right here, but they don't
look like they mean anything. Desert surrounds this area, and the
mountain range to the west is easily visible.

Near Mountains~
Rising up out of the desert is a large mountain range. The peaks are
jagged and tall, stretching into the sky. The mountains extend far to
the north and south, and they are just as irregular and spiky for the
whole length. The desert goes quite a way to the east, and there is 
little to be seen but dunes.

Within The Desert~
This is the deep interior of the desert. There is nothing in this
barren wasteland but endless sand dunes and an occasional small rock.
The tedium of the empty surroundings is mind-blowing, and the heat is
incredibly intense.

Curve in Mountain Range~
A mountain range curves around this spot to the north and to the south.
Wind from the desert has piled up tons of sand into a huge sloping pile
that goes up into the mountain range. At the top of this hill of sand,
there are many large pieces of rock lying scattered around, and little
else, as the pile does not reach to the top of the mountain face. The 
view to the east is very nice, the desert stretches out far, and a city
is visible past it.

Flat Desert~
There's a patch of desert ground that goes almost perfectly flat, with

intense heat or energy.

A very wide pit is dug down about 10 feet into the ground. It is very
shallowly sloped, and there are dunes all around it. In the middle of
the pit there are scattered bones and shredded clothing. Dried blood
is spattered all around. There's a single wagon in the depression
near the bones, filled with rotted food.

Desert~
This is the crest of a huge sand dune. At the very top there is a

white from the constant sun, and all the sharp edges have been worn
down by the constant erosion of the sand. The dune slopes sharply down
to the west at a very steep angle.

Desert~
The desert expanse stretches off to the west, and the sand slowly gives
way to hard packed dirt to the east.  The heat of the desert sun causes
rippling, blurring effects in the air over the sand in the distance. In
this area of the desert, there are many tiny razor-sharp rock slivers mixed
in with the sand.

they are all tall, broad, and shallowly sloped. An immense volume of sand
is in these dunes, and it is moved around constantly by the wind.

All else to the north, as well as this location, is sandy desert, with

and there's a mountain range running north from here on the west side.
The mountains peter out into small foothills past the cliff.

the middle, where the ground slopes down very sharply into a deep pit.
There's a large rusted metal door in the side of the wide pit at the

Underground Passage~
This is a small cramped corridor.  There's a false wall on the east that
is an entrance from the desert.  The corridor is made of light beige
colored stone, and is lit diffusely by no clear source.  There just seems
to be a yellowish light emanating dimly from the air.  There's a small
amount of sand on the floor, and the ceiling and walls are very smooth with
rounded corners.  The floor has a shallow dip in the center, as if worn
away by lots of traffic.  This whole place gives off a feeling of being
very, very old.

there are only a few little spots or random discolorations on the walls.
The color is almost totally unvarying.

old. Dust covers every surface in the corridors with a thick coat of
gray powder.

The air is filled with a strange smoke, or haze. It disappears outside of

tiny hole at the top of a wall that's shooting out a powder. The stench
is massive, and it's difficult to breathe. This gritty smoke is rough, and
it burns while breathing.

of the same beige stone and with the same mysterious glowing air.

Mural Room~
The corridor fans out into a semicircular room with a very large mural
on the curved wall. It is carved into the wall and also made from 
different colored stones that are inlaid in the wall.
The mural depicts a very large group of people involved in a construction
project in the side of a mountain. Most of them look human, but some have
very strange features and arrangements of body parts. They are digging
an underground structure. It shows them finishing it, and then leaving.
A few stay behind and possibly stay for an extended period of time. It's
hard to tell. Sometime later, someone of importance comes to the place. 
He/she/it is larger-than-life and has an aura around them. Three people
each give this person a strangely shaped small object, and then the person
has a red circle hovering above him. The person crushes the red circle
between their hands. A green circle is then hovering in front of him. The
person flies away through the sky holding the green circle. That is the end
of the mural.

in here, and the walls are unadorned and plain. The stone is a yellowish
tan color, with a few off color parts, but very few. The construction was
very, very well done; all the walls are perfectly smooth and this place is
obviously very old. It has stood up to time.

steady source of minerals has caused a fairly large stalactite, and there
are crystalline formations all over the room, almost every surface
sparkles and shines with refracted light. The crystal breaks up the light

walls are very smooth, but here it is very rough. There is also some dirt
strewn around on the floor as well as small rocks. There's really no clue

S-curving Corridor~
The corridor takes a wide, shallow S-curve here, also widening to the
south and thinning to the north. On the walls of the S-curve there are
some symbols and shapes carved, possibly for decoration or possibly for
some purpose. They are very large and simple, like triangles and semi-
circles. There are also a few pentagons and other polygons with many
sides. This seems odd, as there is little to no decoration at all in the
rest of this structure, so the shapes might actually mean something.

Reflective Walls~
All the walls, the ceiling, and the floor in this room are mirrored! The
mirrors are covered with dust, but the light emanating from the air still
bounces around countless times, reflecting repeatedly, making the light
level in this room exceedingly high. It hurts the eyes to look anywhere!
Thousands of mirror images of anyone in the room face in all directions,
from all angles, and it is very disorienting. It's not quite easy to tell
how large the room actually is, but it's pretty small.

The corridor ends abruptly, with an edge that drops off about 20 feet

it would be a very easy climb down. The corridor does not widen out or
anything like that, it stays the same thin width after the dropoff, and
the ceiling does not fall. The floor and ceiling south of the ladder
are separated by about 25 feet or more. The glowing air in this place does
not continue down the ladder, it fades to black downward and outward.

Split Off From Huge Room~
A semi-corridor extends out of the huge pillar room to the west here, and
it's not quite a corridor, it seems more like an extension of the room.
Whatever it is called, it goes a short way and apparently ends. The path
around the pillar also continues unobstructed.

North Side Of Huge Pillar~
This huge room branches off again, to the north. Some very bright green
light is being cast onto the large pillar in the outline of the north 
doorway. Something through that door is giving off a whole lot of very
bright green colored light. On the side of the pillar facing the door,
there are three vertical lines carved from floor to ceiling, glowing
bright red, blue, and yellow, respectively. The carved lines seem to pulse
with strong power, and the glow casts off a lot of heat.

A Very Tiny Room~
The power of the three runes has transported you to this small room, if
it can be called a room. The ceiling is only about 4 feet high, and the
walls are very close together. In the exact center of the floor is a
glowing pedestal that seems to radiate power. Resting on the top of the
pedestal in a carved round hole is a bright red orb. The air around it
wavers and shimmers, as if it is warping reality.

A once lived-in room~
This little cozy room looks like it might be someone's home, but it's
in a state of extreme disrepair. There is a comfy chair with almost all
of the stuffing it once had fallen out or eaten by insects. Various
little things like coffee mugs and pencils are scattered around on some
little tables and small bookshelves. Everything is totally covered
with a thick, thick layer of dust. The room only had one apparent exit, 
to the west.

Portal Room~
The cramped corridor to the south leads into this huge room. It has a
vaulted ceiling with wide support beams running across the top of the
room. The center of the north wall has a huge glowing sphere mounted about
7 feet up from the ground. The sphere casts bright white light into the
room, but the corners of the room are shrouded in pitch-black shadow
nonetheless. There's a mystifying green portal just under the glowing
sphere. It's bright green and it swirls very fast around the center.

Stone Cubes~
This wide, shallow room has tall stone cubes sitting everywhere! Some are
sitting flat, some are leaning against the wall or against other cubes,
and many are taller than they are wide, which technically makes them
rectangular prisms. The shadows cast by these cubes are very interesting,
as for some reason the light in this room does not emanate from the air
evenly, it shifts and changes in patches. This causes the shadows of the
cube, and anyone in the room, to constantly shift in bizarre patterns.

A Very Strange Machine~
The medium sized room is dominated by a huge bank of ancient computers.
There are little lights that long since stopped flashing and spools
of magnetic tape that quit spinning a very long time ago. There are
digital readouts that will never read out again, and buttons that have
been smashed or worn out, levers that have been broken off, and keypads
missing almost all of the keys. However, in one corner, there is a tiny
section of the computer still running! It seems to consist of a red light
that slowly flashes, a quiet speaker that beeps in time with the light,
and possibly a lever just next to them.

Down The Ladder~
This very tall and thin corridor is almost like a chasm, but it is finely
built of the same beige stone as the rest of the structure. The corners
and edges here are not as worn and rounded out as in the previous areas,
perhaps this was an addition? The corridor stretches straight for quite
a long way, and then comes to an end. There is a tall doorway, and it is
bordered by a thick band of carvings on the stone. They are very deeply
carved into the rock, and they rhythmically pulse with a very strong red
light.

A Dark Maze~
You are inside a maze of some kind, and nothing is visible at all.
There is very thick black smoke and fog swirling everywhere, but it
is still breathable. Whenever you take any turn at all, you feel like
you have been spun around and turned inside out! It's very 
disorienting and confusing.

The End Of The Maze!~
Finally, the end of the maze! There is simply a small metal box on
the floor, surrounded by light in otherwise total darkness. There is
also a stone staircase on which to ascend upwards and leave.
The box, strangely, does not look very old, it is steel and open-topped
with no lid. A soft golden glow shines out of the box...

Hundreds of years ago there was a group of warriors dedicated to nothing
but destruction and mayhem.  Their powers were felt everywhere, their
presence felt in the hearts of foes.  This group was known as The Shenkai
Aurei.  They slaughtered their foes without mercy, and they were feared
throughout the galaxy.  In the days of the Galactic war they stayed
neutral, not wanting to become puppets of either government.  The Oroki
wanted the mystic warriors on their side, they wanted them at all costs,
but since they couldn't have them, they sent their own group of assassins
to eliminate the Shenkai Aurei.  The warriors would not be decieved.  They
ambushed the assassins and killed them all.  This attempt to eliminate them
infuriated them, and so they decided to join the Akusha, the Oroki's sworn
enemy.  They fought valiantly by the Akushas' side, killing many of their
enemies.  Their leader Link knew that they were winning the war, yet he
felt that somehow it would all change.  He decided to take in new members. 
The new recruits all did well in their training, yet one excelled above
all.  His name was Clerve.  Link knew that this disciple of his would
change the course of the war.  Before he could finish Clerve's training,
the enemy launched a deadly assault on the Aurei's home planet.  The Aurei
faught gallantly, killing over half of the enemy which outnumbered them one
hundred to one, but they could not match the sheer numbers that the Oroki
threw against them.  They retreated to their most sacred city where the
final battle was fought.  The battle was decisive, and almost all of the
Aurei were slaughtered, their bodies piling up in the streets of their holy
city.  Even Link was slain in the huge battle.  Clerve was seperated from
the rest and injured.  He thought he was about to die, but somehow tapped
into a reserve of power and slaughtered all of the invaders, to the last
man.  He returned to his few remaining people a legend, a hero.  He
gathered his friends Lisker and Xanus with him and started on a journey to
revenge their fallen.  They were all that's left, they are The Remnant of
what once was, but will never be again.  

To join this clan you must have a minumum PL of 50 million, and 5 pks. 
Each week there will be pk tournaments, and the person with the most pks on
a certain day will win zeni/item prizes.  You will receive 50k zeni for
each death certificate that you give to a clan leader, however, you must
have made the kill while they were on to prove that it was indeed your
kill.
