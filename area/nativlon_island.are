A Landing Pad~
As you get off the ship you sense terror in the air. Sand covers the
ground completely, it seems so soft it could engulve you within an instant.
The smell of herbs and weeds is overwhelming. Rocks surround you, big
enough to block out the sun, and large lucious green bushes act as a wall
around the Landing Pad. The path to the north east of here heads into the
golden gates of the city of Daithoneon.

Rhythmic waves caress the shore of the island. The smooth sea surface reflects
light from the sky, showing small eddies captured by deep puddles in the nearby
rocks. Thrown by tidal waves and ocean currents, several bottles are trapped in
this pools, many containing soggy notes to loved ones. The skeletal remains of
an ancient pirate lies partially submerged, occasionally capturing oceanic
debris within its watery grasp.

Diving Under the Water~
Diving into the blue-green seawater, schools of brilliantly colored fish swim
lazily among the corals. These carnivorous fish have grown so accustomed to
human flesh over the years that they have become as sensitive to and attracted
by the scent of human blood as sharks. They often lurk around shiny objects on
these ships in order to find food. Occasional sparkles of sunken treasures
glitter silently in the cold water, yearning to tell their sad tales.

Diving Under the Water~
Deeper into the sea, the rotting hulks of many sunken ships can be seen lying
on the seabed. Multicolored seaweed grows on all available surfaces, and sways
gently in the light current. Osiirans, mermaid-like Nativlons, frequent this area.
Concealed beneath their unearthly beauty is a bloodthirsty hatred for humanity,
both vicious and insatiable. By night, they comb the depths in search of sunken
treasures, leaving mankind to its own devices. However, by day, they take to
the rocks to lure passing ships to their doom. A short distance away, the
seabed drops abruptly and opens into a yawning chasm. No light penetrates the
murky waters of this rift in the sea floor.

In the Depths of the Chasm, Near the Sea Floor~
The water in the chasm is dark and murky. Small, floating bits of seaweed
obscure light sources and make it difficult to see more than a few feet in any
direction. A few feet below lies the sea floor, where seaweed grows in the
silty seabed and small creatures dart in and out of holes in the surrounding
rocks. A massive coral reef can be seen to the north. Schools of fish and other
creatures swarm around the reef, seeming to revel in the very fact that they
exist. The reef is almost bursting with life, and glows faintly with an eerie
light, a stark contrast to the gloomy waters of the rest of the chasm.

A Massive, Blood-Red Coral Reef~
Arriving in front of the immense coral reef, the truth has become disturbingly
clear. The reef itself appears to be a living being, one that has grown
sentient and clearly evil from the influx of human blood to the surrounding
waters. The schools of small fish that appeared to be cavorting in the waters
near the reef are in actuality fleeing from the reef itself, as strands of
blood-red seaweed and stalks of deformed coral reach outward, attempting to
snare unwary prey. The malevolence exuded from the reef permeates the water
surrounding it, making it difficult to move. A gaping hole has been carved into
the reef, apparently leading into its bowels. A sickly red glow pulses from
within the reef, not unlike a heartbeat.

Within the Reef, at the Gates to the Coral Castle~
A long, twisting tunnel leads from the hole in the surface of the reef to this
area. The water is thick with a sense of hatred, as if the coral reef senses
the presence of intruders. Small passages can be seen leading off to both the
east and west. Thin, semi-transparent membranes cover the mouths of these
passages, blocking access to the chambers beyond. A massive arch frames a
gateway, leading deeper within the coral castle. Both the arch and gate are
fashioned of sparkling, blood-red coral. No trace of damage can be found on the
coral, it must have been shaped by magical means. The sight is both horrific
and beautiful to behold.

otherworldly aura to this darkened cavern. All along one wall is a high shelf,
molded of coral and driftwood, hosting numerous containers and bottles. A tangy

from shipwrecks and lost cargo of storms have been arranged to provide seating.

Crossing a Perilous Bridge~
A sturdy drawbridge connects the gate with the castle wall. Unnaturally long
and straight blood-red corals make up the body of the bridge. Collections of
rarely seen seashells adorn the bridge, sparkling in rainbow colors. These
seashells are as deadly as they are beautiful. Countless tiny, almost invisible
poisonous thorns cover the surface of these seashells. These thorns inject
colorless poison into the body when touched. The poison causes respiratory
difficulty, which leaves the victims to drown in the icy ocean water.

lighting up the entrance to the castle. As if you are stepping into another
realm, all water is forced from the interior rooms, allowing land creatures to
breathe freely within. The corpses of various types of fish lie scattered upon
the ground, having mistakenly crossed the invisible barrier to their doom.
Under the lanterns' glow these coral walls emit an eerie red light.

An Undiscovered Cavern behind the Waterfall of Doom~
An irregular opening reveals a large cavern hidden by the raging waterfall. An
oval-shaped pool occupies the center of the cavern. An arched stalagmite,
resembling an ancient tree trunk, spurts from the bottom of the pool and
connects to the ceiling. Next to the stalagmite, a small opening on the ceiling
provides light for the cavern. Veins of Ceruleanrosa seep through cracks,
decorating the bare walls. The sweet smell of Ceruleanrosa permeates the room,
intoxicating all living beings.

Waterfall of Doom~
Thunder-like noise of water accompanying the magnificent waterfall is
awe-inspiring. Crystal clear water splashes in all directions, keeping the area
moistened. Vivid green moss covers parts of the rocks and trees along the sides
of the cascade. Chilly mists veil the area, dividing the world from the
cataract. The raging waterfall drops into a seemingly endless abyss, giving it
the name of Doom.

The Windy Stream~
The heather-scented east-bound winds toss you on the calm waters of this narrow
but deep stream. Its banks are thick with matted mosses, mushrooms, and water
lilies, a few trees hover over the stream's edge collecting the silvery dew of
the water spray.

A cool breeze, softened by passage through the trees, filters in, carrying
pleasant scents of white lilies and aster. The light falls in hypnotic dappled
patterns on the earthen floor of the glade, and birds sing their music from
somewhere closeby and unseen. This looks like a wonderful place to spend an
afternoon, or a cloudless starlit night.

Quite suddenly the narrow stream bed opens out and gives way to the broad
northern sea, faithfully reflecting the whites and blues of the sky. In the
distance, far offshore, you can barely make out the outline of a deadly pirate
ship....but you feel safely unseen here, and there is no dock for them to land
at this place. Some sort of thin path leads west over a rocky outcrop.

upon the rocks, filling the air with a salty taste. As you scamper across
these jetties, you realize they are thick with wet, slippery algae, making
movement treacherous. Small pools of water have formed, housing a
multicolored wilderness of ocean creatures.

The smell of water lilies wafts in the air, surrounding this quaint pond with
serenity. A mother duck patiently teaches her babies how to swim and dive,
quacking every so often in approval or discontent. To the left of the pond is a
hammock, swaying gently in the breeze. Long branches of weeping willow dip into
the water, sending ripples across the otherwise smooth surface in almost
hypnotic waves. Calm and peaceful, the quiet tranquility of this area beckons
visitors to rest, relax, lie upon the tender grass, or nap under a tree.

water lilies. Beds and beds of brilliantly colored flowers magically compose
themselves into intricate patterns of ancient symbols. Clusters of trees
mysteriously form shapes of animals, objects, and legendary figures, animating
the park. The leaves and petals of these plants rustle constantly, as if alive,

depths. Echoes of weeping and mourning spring from the fathoms below, haunting
listeners with melancholy. Barely visible etchings at the base of the well tell
a tale of haunted souls captured by the Nativlons. The tears of the victims fill
this basin.

only those travelers who have been completely and thoroughly searched for
illegal items of one form or another.  What could possibly be the reason
for such extreme precautions?  The entire process is a very efficient one,

This section of the Dailthoneon is little different from the others, in
that it is covered by the same cobblestone. But, the townspeople seem to be
distancing themselves from a strange looking object in the center of the
square. They whisper amongst themselves and throw a few glances at it, but
their attitude seems to be one of awe and respect. Deciding to investigate
further, you approach the strange shape, and are surprised to see it is but a
huge, ornately decorated, golden harp. It stands about once again your height
and hums with a soft, gentle sound.

A Sandy Beach Along a Hidden Cavern on the Island~
An endless stretch of white sand beach circumscribes the island.  Large
palm trees sway in the cool sea breeze.  A large flat rock, called Maledet,
with a smooth surface, has just enough space for two bodies to lie on top
of it.  The rock bears the tragic legend of the Nativlon goddess Kdorthea.
It is said that the rock can detect true love.  If two people lie on top of
the rock under a full moon and are truly in love, they will be blessed and
protected by Kdorthea. Otherwise, the couple will crumble into glittering
white sand.

Some call the wind, some create lightning, and others rain fire.  The
festival always concludes with a dance competition between nine selected
Nativlons.  Each of the competitors has to design an unique dance to honor
their goddess Kdorthea.  The prize for the best dancer is a golden bowl

Dailthoneon rises above the ground in splendor.  To the west lies the

A Bend in MacMillan Street~
The high walls surrounding the city hamper your vision to the north and
to the west.  It is quite odd that such a seemingly secure little city
would have need of such staunch fortification as provided by these tall,
formidable stone walls.  It seems that you are in the northwestern most
part of Dailthoneon City.

the shopkeepers is strewn about the ground behind their buildings, and
a fairly rancid odor can be detected in the air.  All manner of vermin
crawl about through the garbage, only stopping to stare at you every so
often.

streets in Daithoneon, and certainly one of the most important to its
economy.  As you walk along you see nearly every kind of shop imaginable,
selling anything you could possibly ever need or desire.  To the north you
see Aliath Avenue, and to the west you see an Armory shop.

be staring at you openly, you can hear them murmuring as you pass.

A double doorway from the foyer opens onto an expansive great hall. Sections of
the sloped roof are cut out and filled with intricate stained glass, so at any
hour of the day or night, sunlight and moonlight sparkle on the floor in a
myriad of colors. A dais on the west side of the room holds a long table.
Before it is a smooth dance floor, tiled in complex patterns of hardwood
parquet. Tables and chairs line the other sides of the hall, the tables bearing
trays and goblets of purest silver. Sweet-smelling reeds cover the floor, and
every step over them makes a soft swishing sound. The breeze from the foyer
courses over the strings of harps and lyres stored in the orchestra area in the
corner, making constant, quiet music.

Daith Street~
Inside this massive hollow mountain is this wonderful bustling city.
Along the streets are homes, shops, and other business buildings.  People
move up and down the street quickly and happily trying to go about their
business.  High intensity high beam lights line the sides of the street
providing all the light that is needed to see.  There are quaint little
benches on the sidewalk beside the street where some elderly couples sit
and remember old times.  The streets are clean of leaves or trash and if
some of the dust was wiped they would look like something out of a
fairy-tale.

The street continues to the north and south inside this massive hollow

and out browsing and buying. On the sides of the road are street lamps to light
the way for pedestrians. Children run back and forth playing and doing the
things children do. Couples walk up and down the street holding hands and
smiling. On either side of the street, next to the lamps, are benches placed
for those who wish to rest their feet.

Before the Sanctuary of Spirits~
This small hallway functions as a conduit between the streets and the great
temple that serves as the center of religious worship for the town. The floor
is made of a pure diamond-like material under which can be seen strange
engravings. A flood of water glowing with a luminescent light flows across the
engravings beneath the material lending an otherworldly aspect to the room.
Tall white columns line both sides of the walkway and strange sandstone
pedestals form mysterious formations which arise up from beneath the material.
The waters edge around the stones, repelled by an invisible energy which
prevents its spread. Crystal statues of great dragons sit upon each pedestal in
memory of those who have entered the spirit world. They hum quietly with
energy, sparkling as they are embraced by an unknown source of light.

Sanctuary of Spirits~
A strange sphere weaves through the rising mist sending rays of light in all
directions. Sparkling golden dust trails from above and disappears into a
tranquil flow of water below, which ends abruptly, as though whisked away by an
unseen force. An otherworldly song arises beautifully from a distance, the
gentle voice slow and sweet, coaxing with it's soft loving melody and embracing
the crystal altar which radiates with an inner light. A transparent dragon
statue glows strongly, seemingly touched by the tune. It brightens and flares,
sending a powerful beam of light towards the heavens and causing rainbows to
swirl around it in a graceful dance, as energy seeps from the statue into it.

YOOOOOOOOOOOOO~
Bright orbs float in midair glowing with an inner light, filling the
cobblestone street with silver and gold radiance. Sparkling diamond-like stones
surround the edges of the cobblestone path, entwined with beautiful cyan leaves
and bright blue flowers which appear to dance, as a glowing water flows
westward within the transparent material from which they bloom. Lush green
vines form an archway to the east and peculiarly beautiful flowers hang from
them like a veil in an array of white and violet. The heavy perfumed scent of
the flowers floats in the air, spread by a breeze with no direction and no
reasonable source.

Hardbids Happy House of Ale~
This narrow but deep room is dominated by a mammoth oak bar which runs the
entire length of the tavern. Smoke from a great open fire fills the air and the
smell mingles with that of stale sweat and spilt ale. A healthy crowd jostles
one another in a desperate attempt to attract the barkeep's attention in the
quest for a cool drink. The back of the tavern features a raised plinth upon
which travelling minstrels entertain the crowd, whilst a small stairwell leads
down, presumably to the cellars beneath. Seemingly scattered haphazardly around
are a collection of well-worn stools and tables, all of which have seen far
better days.

Hardbids Cellar~
Faint flickers of light trickle down from the tavern above but otherwise this
cold, damp cellar is swathed in shadow and darkness. In the minimal light can
be seen stacks of casks piled from floor to ceiling, each bearing a strange
mark to distinguish the many varied brands and brewers. Although primarily
stocked with casks, a small wine rack can just about be distinguished against a
wall, filled almost to overflowing with a range of distinctive glass bottles,
many of whom are covered in a thick layer of dust and cobwebs strongly
indicating the preferences of the patrons in the tavern above. A faint rustling
noise can be heard in the shadows although whether it is a rodent or simply a
noise filtering down from the room above is impossible to tell.

A Narrow Underground Tunnel~
The tunnel begins to widen into a larger area and light can be seen coming from
up ahead. The darkness from behind slowly fades away and more and more becomes
visible. The tunnel slowly becomes more of a cavern-like area and the walls
have changed from packed mud into solid stone. The floor is covered with small
pebbles that definitely did not just appear out of nowhere. Possibly these
pebbles came from the meadow or possibly from somewhere up ahead.

A Narrow Underground Tunnel~
The tunnel flattens out here still heading south. The darkness now completely
surrounds everything. Above the tree roots have either disappeared or the
ceiling has grown higher. The tunnel grows more humid and water drips from the
ceiling here covering the ground with a very thin lair of wet mud. The area has
stopped growing narrower for the moment and is easier to pass through. Every
sound echos to the east and west making it hard to tell if any of the footsteps
belong to others.

A Narrow Underground Tunnel~
As the tunnel continues deeper and farther beneath the surface the light in the
tunnel is reduced to almost nothing. The tunnel narrows a bit ahead and
continues downward at a slight decline. The roots of the plants above have
turned into unmistakably the roots of the trees of the forest. The tunnel
continues east into complete darkness and the unknown. The walls of the tunnel
are covered in small holes, each just big enough to fit a finger into. This
could possibly a way to tell where one is in the tunnel or they could just be
the result of burrowing worms and insects.

A Narrow Underground Tunnel~
This tunnel leads deep under the meadow into the unknown. It appears to be
man-made in nature and the ground here is made of packed down mud. Very little
light filters down this far into the tunnel but there is a little from behind.
The tunnel leads straight to south and narrows a little in some areas. Roots of
the grass and bushes of the meadow can be seen above hanging out of the ground.
They spread out across the ceiling of the tunnel strengthening it and soaking
up moisture from the air in the tunnel, keeping it very dry.

A Cavern Beneath the Pool~
From above the tunnel was completely disguised by the meadow brook. It appeared
to be a normal brook in every way, with swirling currents and the natural
carved rocks and floor of one. Now, ripples of light filter down from the water
above into the cavern you are now in. The cavern is completely devoid of water,
and looking up there is only a thin sheet of water hovering magically overhead.
Filtered light of the day ripples and wraps the contents of the tunnel in
intricate pattern. Looking up the distortions are not of what was from where
you previously came but of far off places enswathed in the changing currents of
the waters. The tunnel continues down, fading into darkness.

Heart of the Dragon~
Before you kneel to your glorious Lord Nativlon, strongest of the
surviving memory of what once was.  Behind him his throne in all its glory,
solid gold and platinum, with perfect red velvet carpet cascading it in
every direction.  His powerful upward gaze never staggering always honoring
his true strength.  A single blue tear trickles down his cheek and
dissappears under his chin.  Before him stands the mage Prince Morias,
loyal son and forever friend to his father the king.  His eyes glow with
the most powerful magic his soul can bring forth. From the kings deepest
memories he conjures a perfect image of the resting place of the eternal
dragon. The midnight sky in all its glory streamed out into the endless
unknown above his head.  A bright constellation in the unwavering shape of
the eternal dragon rests directly in the middle.  You know in your heart
that the king mourns, always mourns for his beloved friends. which all the
gold in the world cannot bring back.  Just outside await the rest of the
King's lineage, always waiting for his mourning to cease, always mourning
at his side.

Some long-gone stonemason left a gap inside the wall of the Castle, allowing for
a tiny passage that bypasses the lower floors. There is a bright light
overhead, and you can make your way towards it, or towards the storage cellar

Deep wood shelves line every wall of the cellar, packed with tightly sealed
jars and canisters of rice and grain, sacks of potatoes and onions, jars of
saffron and spices, crates of soap, dye, and nails, and boxes and bags of every

What was once a training room of the Castle has fallen steeply into disrepair.
The maps and teaching materials that once hung on the walls have fallen down,
leaving only bare, rusted nails overhead and crumpled piles of fragile,
decaying parchment underfoot. The remains of a few desks, their wood frames
rotten and covered with mildew, lie in the middle of the floor where they fell.
Even the spiders that inhabit the lower hallways and dungeons of the Keep seem

A Virtual Fighter Arena~
Your sensors are as if they dont work, sending you no data, as if the
room doesnt even exsist.  The room consists of an endless black void. The
fighter stands there motionlessly, ready for you to attack.  The Virtual
Fighter glows under a white mystical nothingness. It has basic human
features, a head, torso, arms, legs, and feet.  It still awaits you to
attack.

An Elegant Corridor~
Unlike the bare stone office corridors below, this one is paneled in dark,
knurled wood and carpeted with a narrow runner of thick, deep midnight blue.
Sconces of brass, polished to a shine that makes them gleam like gold, hold
candles of the same dark blue, illuminating the corridor in gentle, calming
light.

An Elegant Corridor~
The sounds of your footsteps are muffled by the thick blue rug that lines the
corridor. Light comes from matching candles set into shining sconces on the
wood-paneled walls. Music fills the air, just loud enough to hear, calming the
senses and entertaining the mind while it covers the noise from the streets
below. The corridor opens up to the south, where a stone archway leads into a
spacious, elegantly appointed office.

The Office of the Dean of the Castle~
A massive, L-shaped desk of dark, knotted wood fills easily a quarter of the
office. A crystal vase on the desk holds several quills of various colors and
shapes, and a wooden filing box with dozens of compartments is filled with
scrolls and parchment. A dark blue candle in a bronze holder sits next to a
stick of gold sealing wax and a heavy brass sigil, used for sealing the Dean's
correspondence. Paintings and portraits of previous deans and professors cover
the walls, and their warm, knowing faces seem to follow you around the room. A
soft and comfortable-looking chaise sits in one corner, and a magically glowing
orb hovers over it, providing a cozy and bright reading space. One
entire wall is devoted to bookshelves, where leather books as large as
flagstones share space with silk-bound journals and ancient, stained tomes of
magic.

Welcome to the Island Nativlon~
A beautiful white sandy beach wraps itself around the water, the sand
warm and inviting although the source of the warmth is not readily
apparent.  The skyline glows the gold and red hues seen during a beautiful
sunset, the tranquility and peace of the area a lure for the unwary.  The
beach continues to the north, and the city starts to the east

The Golden Gates to the City of Daithoneon~
The huge iron bars blocking the entrance to the city are very
conspicuous indeed.  A group of guards is constantly on watch, admitting
only those travelers who have been completely and thoroughly searched for
illegal items of one form or another.  What could possibly be the reason
for such extreme precautions?  The entire process is a very efficient one,
and travelers pour in at a constant rate.  To the west you see an outdoor
sparring arena

The sent of popcorn, hot dogs, and any other kind of food you can
immagine overwhelm you.  There are kids sitting at tables beside the wall.
Looks like they have eaten quite a bit, and will probly go the The Big
Couch to sleep a while. The line isn't too long, you should go get
something to eat before the line gets too big. There is an attractive woman
behind the counter.  With a man working the other half, maybe you should go
and talk to her, maybe she will give you a deal...

there is a Popcorn machine, poping popcorn non-stop.  You begin to drool
from the smells of all the food.  You're hungry and want a bite to eat. The
woman waits patiently for you to order, there begins to be a line forming
behind you.  You better order before the other customers begin to complain.

Colossal trees grow to the east and west of you, preventing further travel in

The thick branches of an enormous oak tree protrude from beneath the earthen
ground, having eroded through the forest floor. The massive bole of the tree
steeply slopes downward to the west, but is far too dangerous to attempt to
climb or slide down it. A cluster of bushes and deciduous plant life grows to
the north, impeding further travel in that direction.

This particular hill-like trail is covered in knee-high blades of bright
lavender grass. Colossal trees, including oak, birch, maple, and pine, grow to
the east and west of you. The trees' thick branches form an intertwined maze of
confusion overhead, allowing only pinpoints of the sky's light to beam into the
area. The path slopes downward to the south, and slants upwards to the north.

As you fall from somewhere, you notice a clump of hay which seems to
break your fall....accept you completely missed it. Ancient cave pantings
cover the ceiling above you as you look upon them with awe. Simbilising
ancients myths of the island, or perhaps not of the island. Gold is
scattered along the floor, this must be the ancient Nativlon treasure cave.

Raditz's Lil' Brothel House~
Chicks surround you as you enter the place, a sense of discomfort is
over whelming here indeed. Poles are structured everywhere in a strategic
position for dancers to.....dance on. A Counter lays in the corner, clusted
with papers and girls clothing....kinky clothing. There appears to be many
doors leading off to rooms where people are doing what the very point of
this place is;)

A Private Room~
A Bed in the corner is all thats in the room bar a couple of clothing, A
hooker sits on the bed, awaiting you for some action. The room seems to be
small, maybe because of the size of the bed.  A couple of paintings hang
all over the wall seeming to be the only source of formality in this place.

A Jewish Bar-Mitzvah House~
This small room seems to hold jewish bar-mitzvah's, set up like a
church, it has 5 rows of seats, a stand up the front, in which one will
recite the bar-mitzvah requirements, and statues of their gods. The walls
are made out of a white limestone which seems to reflect the light
rebounding off the see-through part off the roof.

A Virtual Fighter Arena~
Your sensors are as if they dont work, sending you no data, as if the
room doesnt even exsist.  The room consists of an endless black void. The
fighter stands there motionlessly, ready for you to attack.  The Virtual
Fighter glows under a white mystical nothingness. It has basic human
features, a head, torso, arms, legs, and feet.  It still awaits you to
attack.
