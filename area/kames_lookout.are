tapestries and velvet curtains have been hung from the roof and walls and
are further accented by the light of a hundred candles, which dances and
flickers all about you.  In the center of everything, resting against the

to the north is a cramped looking passage and the stairs are located to the
east.

The walls are only three feet apart here , leaving you feeling a little

sound creates a loud booming echo.  Suddenly your vision is obscurred by a
bright light radiating from a crack in the door to the north, you then
wonder if you should explore any further, or return to the large stone
platform to the south.

The Path to Korin's Tower~
As you proceed along this small dirt path the dry broken soil crunches
under your feet, stirring up small clouds of dust.  You see a gigantic white
tower to the north, it is said to be the home of the powerfull magician
Korin.
