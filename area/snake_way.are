past his shoulders.

ripples behind him in a wind you don't feel, and you notice one of
his swords is half composed of pure energy.

Way, a large, well maintained airstrip running down the
middle.  Flights are frequently landing or taking off, carrying
spirits, other martial artists, along with various Kais or
Guardians of certain planets.

Snake Way~
Stretching out before you is the daunting length of Snake Way.  It seems
to go on and on, disappearing into the distance.  Miles and miles of grey
road and metallic blue spikes along the sides of the narrow road. How long
is this thing?  For all you know, this could take hundreds of years.  You
can already feel yourself getting bored, mind wandering as you travel down
the seemingly endless length of coiling, twisting, turning road.

at all different about any foot of this place.  It just goes on and on,
seemingly neverending.  It's all blurring together, you can't even tell
which way you should go now.  Right or left, it doesn't seem to matter, the
road just stretches on and on...

Near Princess Snake's Castle~
The endless monotony of Snake Way is suddenly interrupted by
a huge mansion breaking through the orange clouds.  It has a definate
Asian feel to it.  The only entrance seems to be a giant snake's mouth...

Snake Way~
Stretching out before you is the daunting length of Snake Way.  It seems
to go on and on, disappearing into the distance.  Miles and miles of grey
road and metallic blue spikes along the sides of the narrow road.  Nothing
at all different about any foot of this place.  It just goes on and on,
seemingly neverending.  It's all blurring together, you can't even tell
which way you should go now.  Right or left, it doesn't seem to matter, the
road just stretches on and on...

Snake Way~
Stretching out before you is the daunting length of Snake Way.  It seems
to go on and on, disappearing into the distance.  Miles and miles of grey
road and metallic blue spikes along the sides of the narrow road.  Nothing
at all different about any foot of this place.  It just goes on and on,
seemingly neverending.  It's all blurring together, you can't even tell
which way you should go now.  Right or left, it doesn't seem to matter, the
road just stretches on and on...

Stretching out before you is the...end of Snake Way!?  You've actually
made it to the tail of the giant snake.  Now...where's King Kai?  You
think you can see something, up in the sky.  Maybe you're supposed
to jump, or fly?

and you feel the pull getting ever stronger.

Understanding the Gravity of the Situation~
Suddenly the pulling force increases, yanking you down hard onto
the tiny planet's surface.  Now you realize that because of its small
size, the mini-planet has many, many times the gravity of Earth
or any of the other normal sized planets.

Middle of King Kai's Planet~
This space in the middle of the tiny planetoid seems to be the landing
zone for most of the visiting fighters.  You'll certainly never forget
your crash landing.  The intense gravity slamming you into the ground
and holding you there until you were strong enough to move again.

Next to King Kai's House~
Nearing a classic car, a small hut comes into view. Made entirely
of bricks it seems almost too small to use. The doorway reaches
a staggering four feet in height, making it next to impossible to get
inside. Laughter as well as the occassional grunt and screech of
a monkey is heard.

The gravity hinders movement to the point of collapse, and trekking
any distance at all would make visitors realize that they are going
in circles.  A snort followed by a rather disturbing laugh, almost 
pig-like, is heard in the distance as a short being with antennae can
be seen, laughing at his own jokes in front of a hut.

King Kai's Planet~
The gravity hinders movement to the point of collapse, and trekking
any distance at all would make visitors realize that they are going
in circles.  A snort followed by a rather disturbing laugh, almost 
pig-like, is heard in the distance as a short being with antennae can
be seen, laughing at his own jokes in front of a hut.

Nearing a picnic table, a small hut comes into view. Made entirely
of bricks it seems almost too small to use. The doorway reaches
a staggering four feet in height, making it next to impossible to get
inside. Laughter as well as the occassional grunt and screech of
a monkey is heard.

King Kai's House~
Entering the small hut, it becomes readily apparent that people over
four feet tall were never meant to go this far.  Most people squat and
squeeze their way into the tiny space, making the small man giggle
and snort as he watches your antics.  He cuts himself a slice of pie,
but seems more than eager to train you in the legendary techniques.

Basement~
Up ahead is one of the odd wooden shacks built against the cave wall,
and you can see where the basement cave curves around past it.
You can see along the back and side of the basement, now.  There 
seems to be a shack on three of the four rouded cave walls, the
fourth one holding the staircase back up to the mansion.

Secret Chamber~
The cave wall opens when touched at just the right spot, revealing
a hidden room under the mansion.  The walls shift and change slowly,
slipping from cave to the wooden interior of the mansion to a sheer
metal prison.  Things are not as they seem.

Belly of the Snake~
Ugh.  Why'd it have to be snakes?

You've been swallowed down into the belly of the beast.  Pink walls,
the long throat of the dying creature, surround you.  Slowly, weakly
trying to squeeze you down to be digested.  But, you think you see
an exit...perhaps you can manage to force your way back out the
snake's mouth...why does this seem so familiar?

Treasure Chamber~
This simple wooden shack looks like a guard's hut.  Just a comfortable
chair, a few books to pass the time, and whatever snake girl happens
to be on guard duty at the time.  But what is she guarding?  There
seems to be nothing down here.  Perhaps the guard has already managed
to hid the prize on her person.

Hell~
Fighters around the area appear burdened, as if their training had just
become even more grueling since they fell from the sky.  Obviously they
were unable to complete the long journey to the great trainer people
speculate about. More dangerous than the heat, pain, and pressure is the
boredom.

Spiky Wall of Hell~
A lovely place indeed.  Grunts and groans associated with lifetimes of
failure hang in the air.  Being a place for eternal losers, it lacks what a
female touch could fix.  Pillars of sharp spikes litterally surge from the
terrain, almost as if someone had summoned them.

Ferris Wheel~
Things get stranger and stranger.  Rising up in the middle of Hell is a
ferris wheel.  It's very tall, very large, capable of holding a huge amount
of the nearly weightless spirits. The blue and green machine turns slowly,
pumping out happy, dingy muzak to amuse those souls waiting here.  The
fighters wandering by don't seem amused.

Spikes and sharp rocks jut out randomly, and as most people have

Racetrack~
To amuse the spirits while they wait in this hell, several amusement
park rides have been set up.  You've wandered into the middle of one, a
paved go-cart racetrack.  Fluffy ghosts driving little racecars zip past
you, usually avoiding any fighters that wander into their way pretty well. 
Usually.

Dead End~
Nowhere to go but the way you came.  Or something.  There's no escape
from Hell this way, at least.  Just a wall full of deadly, gleaming spikes
in front of you.  I wouldn't try climbing those.  Ouch.

Dead End~
Patches of orange fog, so thick, it's almost able to be plucked and molded.
Wading through the cloud like smog, it becomes apparent that it was 
a mistake to look for an exit here. Glancing around, the smog seems to
have eased up, just a little, enough for a quick view of the way you entered
this dead end.

Hell~
Nearby, the roaring of engines reminds you of the go-carts that will
eternally race around Hell's track to amuse the spirits trapped here.
A lone spike juts from the ground here, though nearbly a huge wall
of the gleaming, metal things rest.

Hell~
Narrowly missing a sharp spike that appears to have come out of 
nowhere, the ground seems to even out. Fighters around the area appear 
burdened, as if their training had just become even more grueling
since they fell from the sky. Obviously they were unable to complete
the long journey to the great trainer people speculate about.

Spikey Wall of Hell~
A lovely place indeed.  Grunts and groans associated with lifetimes of
failure hang in the air.  Being a place for eternal losers, it lacks what a
female touch could fix.  Pillars of sharp spikes litterally surge from the
terrain, almost as if someone had summoned them for their own bidding.

Hell~
An oppressive humidity hangs about the area, but the flitting, bobbing
spirits seem not to notice it.  They continue to play and laugh, while
the few fighters allowed to keep their physical forms sweat and toil in 
the heat.  Even the increased gravity doesn't seem to affect the little
clouds in the slightest.

Hell~
King Yemma should think about installing air conditioning down here, 
then perhaps he could get past all the bad PR Hell gets.  But that's 
probably not going to happen any time soon.  The rocky floor stretches out 
in front of you, gleaming spikes jutting up from the ground at random intervals.

Dead End~
This rock wall stretches up very high, nearly scraping the orange
clouds above.  However, there doesn't seem to be any feasible way to 
climb up it.  Spikes and sharp rocks jut out randomly, and as most 
people have discovered, you can't simply fly out of Hell.  Oh well, 
there must be an exit somewhere else.

You've finally made it to the front of the line.  Through a huge
archway is the oversized office you spotted earlier, a giant
seated at the enourmous desk.  Noone seems to be stopping
you from just walking inside...

The floating spirits seem a little annoyed that you're simply
slipping past them and cutting in line.  However, it doesn't seem
like they can do anything about it, either.  As you continue,
you think you spot some sort of large office.

Arrival~
"I remember...dying..."

So, this is the afterlife?  It seems so...weird.  You awaken at the
beginning (or end?) of a long hallway.  Floating around are many
giggling, babbling spirits.  You seem to be one of the few with
a solid body still.  Wonder what could be down this hallway...?

Whoops!  For whatever reason, you've fallen off Snake Way!  Even
whatever powers of flight you might have won't save you now.  You plummet
uncontrolably downwards, tumbling through orange clouds, headings towards
who-knows-what below.  Maybe next time you'll pay more attention.

Lab of Dr. Gero and Dr. Myuu~
This huge lab must be well hidden, but you can tell you're still in
Hell.  Who would have such equipment here?  Computers, huge cabinets and
freezers full of speciments, as well as piles of scrap metal.  A few tables
seem to have pieces of androids half put together.  Most of the cavern is
taken up by a gigantic super computer, though, with a blinking monitor.  It
also has a slot about the size of a standard coin, with a slot near the
floor.  A glorified coke machine?  Or maybe it offers something more
interesting...

Core Training Area~
A hidden trap door on King Kai's planet leads down to this special
training area.  It seems being closer to the center of this planet has
increased the pull of gravity even more!  The humans have used
this private area to train at a higher level, to try and surpass all the
other alien martial artists.

(NOTE : Say 'return' to go back to King Kai's planet.)

SUPER FLAMING BAR-B-QUE~
What the hell is this shit?  This place sorta looks like King Kai's
planet, only more gay. A King Kai lookalike flips burgers for his buddies
near a familiar house.  Underneath the nearby tree rests what looks like a
horned Namek and a Human with a mohawk.  Are they cuddling?  Ewwwww. Off in
the distance you hear crashing noises, and it seems like another party of
weirdoes is busy demolishing something nearby.  Crazy.

Where could the Icers have gotten all this nice furniture to spruce up

Anyways, it's very comfortable and homey in this room, several
plush couches and chairs set up around a table stocked with tea and
crumpets.

Core Training Area~
Amazing!  It seems a special training room has been installed right
at the center of King Kai's planet!  There's not much room, and the
pull of gravity is incredibly heavy, but there's something about the
bizarre makeup of this area that keeps you from feeling too worn out.
