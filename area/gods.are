Goku's Hangout~
   You find yourself in a cozy little room.  This is where Goku comes when
he needs break from all the chaos that goes on in the universe. On the wall
you can see a small monitor that is constantly beeping with text scrolling
down the screen.  There is also a small desk in the corner that has, on top
of it, a small computer terminal.  The computer terminal is making a lot of
noise.

You see lines and lines of code on the screen.  Your only guess

As the name suggests, these are the gates of hell.  The burning heat
comming from all directions is overwhelming.  A large desk made of
Brimstone stands on its lonesome here.  There appears to be some charred
papers on the desk here, along with a very large pen with the carved head
of a dragon on the end.  In the distance there is a perpetual heavy black
storm swirling around a large and demeaning looking tower.  The voices of
the forever tormented souls wail from all directions, beconing all to join
them in there endless punnishment for there lives before them.

The Pathway to Krillin's Mind...~
Appearing in such a place causes a moment of confusion before the feel
of gravity slips away, giving off the feeling of helplesness only to follow
with a sudden realization that you're not in 'Kansas' anymore. Strange
pulses of light emit from the far distances, like shooting stars, passing
by in all distances. Amist the center of the vast void would be a mirror,
plain and true. Upon closer inspection, it looks shattered, yet together
like a puzzle, completed like a life-long ordeal. Glimpses of light run
through the cracks, sealing it together to form a single pane of glass,
only to shatter at the slightest touch...
