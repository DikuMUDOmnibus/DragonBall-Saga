56 ''IMM AUTH' 'IMM AUTHORIZE'~
&C
Associated help files: authorize

Authorize <player> name -- This is the command used to allow a player to
  continue past DBS's pre-auth area, but will make them choose
  a new name prior to entering the Academy.  Use this command if the name
  is questionable, modern, or rude.  If the name is acceptible, but in all
  caps, accept the name, but send them a tell requesting they not use all
  caps for their name in the future. &R DBS doesn't use this option yet&C

Authorize <player> yes -- This is used to accept a players name.  Once this
  command is used, the player requires no further Immortal commands to enter
  DBS.

Authorize <player> no -- This command is exclusively used to deny players
  with extremely rude or profane names and banned sites.  Use this command
  sparingly.

Levels 51-54 have primary responsibility for character authorization.  All
Immortals should periodically type 'authorize' to assure their are not any
players waiting for authorization.  The new system allows the Immortals a
bit of time to decide if an name is appropriate before accepting or denying
it.  If you are in doubts to a names acceptibilty, but it is not profane or
extremely modern, you should probably accept it.

53 AASSIGN~
&C
Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are

AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or
instazone will affect this area.

To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.

&rWarning&C!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.

In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you by a Greater God or higher.

In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by an Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed
only Lesser+ can aassign themselves nonproto areas.

0 ABSORB~
&B===============================================================================&C
Androids may not possess any ki of their own but their internal power sources
are more than able to refine it for their use.  By grappling with an
opponent they are able to literally suck their energy right out and use it
themselves.  This also absorbs combat data directly from the enemy, allowing
them to increase their tech level faster than simply fighting.  Using
absorbs costs 4 focus, and - of course - no energy.

&wUpdate:

Type E androids are able to gain an upgraded form of absorb, that
allows them to drain more energy out of their opponent per use than normal.
The upgraded form of absorb costs double the normal focus to use.

-1 AD ADS ADVERTISING~
&C
It is against the rules of this mud to advertise another mud either on
public channels (say, chat, ask, answer, shout, yell, music, quest, avatar,
newbiechat, any guild, order, clan or council channel, wartalk or racetalk),
through your title, description, or biography or via leaving a note on any
public, guild, order, clan or council board in the Realms.  If you are
asked to desist and do not do so immediately, your priveleges on this mud
may be restricted or terminated.

0 ADMINBUILDER ADMIN_BUILDER~
&B=============================================================================&C

Admin Builders are builders that have been promoted after building
at least one *good* area that has been installed.  They are there
to not only continue to build areas, since they have proved to be
very capable of that, but to also help the newer builders learn how
to successfully build on DBS.  They are expected to offer tips and
tricks, explain the glitches and odd points of the building system
on this MUD, and keep an eye out to make sure none of the
lower builders are attempting to pull any tricks in their new areas,
or are simply making a bad area because they don't know any
better or want to help their mortal or their friends.  They also have
more responsibilites, like patrolling channels and checking for
botters and other players breaking the rules.  Finally, Admin
Builders are generally involved in the higher operations of the MUD,
helping to decide what areas should go in or should be built
next, as well as helping the Coders and Head Builders with things
like quests, watching certain players/Imms, additions to the
MUD (races, attacks, etc.), and helping to correct bugs or
additions that have not gone as planned.

                          +-----------------------+

&WDon't Be An Ass
&Y* &CWe are here to make the mud a better place, and to have fun.  If you're
being an ass, you are part of the problem, not the solution.  Having a
'bad day' is no excuse.  Be nice to everyone!

&WAdmins Are Held At A High Standard Of Conduct
&Y* &CWe are here to set a good example to the players.  We should always be
kind and courteous to ALL players.

&Y* &CWe should respond promptly to all questions asked of us over the admin
channel or on the message boards.

&Y* &CDon't bash or argue with other admins in front of, or with regular
players or over public channels.  Keep it private!

&WDon't Use Admin Powers To Help Players
&Y* &CWe are not allowed to help players in any way that could cause imbalance
in the game.  You may not give players zeni, items, enhancements or
information about an area.  This includes, but is not limited to, renaming
items, buying items, invoking items, or providing information on mobs,
items or rooms.  We are, however, allowed to hold tournaments, quizzes,
and the like and give away prizes, but an advanced builder or higher-level
admin MUST authorize these prizes first.

&WDon't Use Excessive Or Unwarranted Punishments
&Y* &CDo not punish someone just because you don't like him or her.  When
anyone is punished place a comment on that person (&WHELP COMMENT&C).  If
there isn't a comment on a player who has been punished, the punishment
will be considered 'unjust'.  The punishment on the player will be lifted
and will not count against the player in any way, and the admin who
punished the player will have his powers restricted until a head builder
or higher-level admin can interrogate the admin in question.  'I forgot'
is not an acceptable excuse.  It will be assumed you were trying to punish
the player with out just cause, unless you can prove differently.  It is
very likely you will lose your job.  Don't forget to post comments on
players!

&WDon't 'Play' The Mud
&Y* &CAdmins should not be playing the mud.  We are here to do our job, if you
want to play the mud make a regular character.  Admins should not be
sparing, grav training, or killing players or mobs, unless they are doing
testing.

Admins who do not follow our code of conduct will be talked to
and encouraged to reread this code.  If they continue to disobey
the code, a panel of head builders and/or higher-leveled admins
will decide what to do about the admin in question.
~

60 ADVANCE~
&C
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

52 ADVANCEDEXITS~
&C
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as
the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.

If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001

To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:
  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do an "rstat")

For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.

The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
  ... here, if a player types 'swim' in the room they will move to room 3001

   forgot to give credit to one of the "grandfathers" of computer adventure
   games... David Platt, the author of the original "Adventure" (c)1979.

   Also credit to Ken Wellsch for porting the original Fortran-77 version
   to UNIX-C (over a period of about 3 years) (c)1984.

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
&B===============================================================================&C
The 'affected' and 'affected by' commands tell you what spells/skills are
affecting your character right now.  So far there is not much to affect you,
but in the future the number should increase dramatically.  The 'affected by'
command will tell you what flags are on your character right now.  Such as
flying, kaioken, super saiyan forms, etc.
~

51 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also
be used when msetting a mobile (mset <mob name> affected <affect flag>).
They may additionally be used to mset players if your level allows it.

0 AFK~
&C&B==========================================================================&C
Going AFK is an abbreviation for going 'Away From your Keyboard'.
The 'afk' command will place an [AFK] flag beside your name on the who
list when activated, as well as informing those who send tells that you
you are afk.  It can be toggled on or off by typing afk, and will also
go off automatically when you enter any command.

~

0 AGGRESSIVE~
&C&B==========================================================================&C
Typing 'style aggressive' will put you into the aggressive style.
This style of combat allows a fighter to strike more effectively, but
leaves many holes in his defenses as well. Fighters who know this tactic
can strike enemies for more damage, but their enemies' attacks will slip
through their defenses for slightly more damage as well.

0 AID~
&B==============================================================================&C
The aid skill allows you to bring a stunned person back to conscious thought.
This is very useful for spars, as afterwards one of the two participants
will be stunned.  Use 'aid <name>' to aid someone.

See Also:  &WSPAR
~

0 ALIAS MACRO TRIGGER~
&B==========================================================================&C
Aliases:
  You are allowed to use single command aliases.  So having an alias 'kf'
  for 'kill fighter' is ok, but if you have an alias 'tg' for 'train grav 
  10, train grav 10,' that is not allowed.

Macros:
  The same rules for aliases apply to macros.  Single command macros are 
  allowed, but multi-command macros are not allowed.

Command Stacking:
  If you're command stacking 'k f' that's fine.  If it's obviously a macro,
  you're going to be shot.

Timers:  You are allowed to use a _save_ timer to send the save command to
  the MUD.  This means 'save', no more, no less.  If you're using it to 
  idle, you'll get smacked.

Speed Walking:  Speed walking is now allowed.

Triggers:  Any triggers of ANY kind are NOT allowed.

No Triggers are allowed. The answer to the tutorial is 'None'.&D
~

52 ALIGNMENT ALIGN ZAPPING~
&B==================================================================================
&C
Your alignment can range from +1000 to -1000. When you are +1000 this
means that you are good aligned, when you are -1000 this means you are
evil aligned, and when you are 0 aligned this means you are neutral.
You can change your alignment by killing good or evil aligned mobs.
This will raise or lower your alignment.

The different alignments will allow you to wear different pieces of
equipment. If you are good aligned and try to wear a piece of equipment
which is antigood, you will be zapped, which means the piece of eq will
fall to the ground. The same occurs when you are evil and you try to
wear an antievil piece of eq, or if you are neutral and try to wear
an antineutral piece of eq. You can also be zapped during battle if you
are fighting a mob opposite of your align.

You can find out what your alignment is by typing SCORE.
~

1 ALLIANCE~
Neutral
-------
Default clan status. Clans can PK but cannot raid or defend.

Friendly
--------
If your clan is friendly towards another clan, you cannot PK members
of that clan. This does not restrict that clan in the same way
unless they are also friendly towards your clan. You cannot raid a
clan that you are friendly towards, but again, this does not apply
both ways.

Allied
------
For this to be active, both clans have to set each other as allied,
otherwise it is considered the same as "friendly". If you are allied
with a clan, all attributes of the "friendly" status apply, plus,
you may help that clan defend against raiders and, during a raid,
their guards will not attack you.

Hostile
-------
If your clan is hostile towards another clan, you may take part in
raids on that clan. This does not apply the other way around unless
that clan is also hostile towards you.

At War
------
For this to be active, both clans have to set each other as "at war",
otherwise it is considered the same as hostile. "At war" status is
open PK mud-wide between the two clans involved. Two leaders from each
clan have to declare 'at war' status. If only one leader has declared
wars so far, the 'clanallies' command will show that leader's name.
~

58 ALLOW BAN~
&C
ALLOW BAN WARN
Syntax:  allow  site/race/class    <address/race/class>
Syntax:  ban    site/race/class    <address/race/class>   <type>    <duration>
Syntax:  ban    show               <class/site/race>      <number>
Syntax:  warn   <site/class/race>  <number>

BAN site will ban a site from playing the game.
BAN race bans anyone with that race from playing the game.
BAN class bans anyone with that class from playing the game.
BAN site/race/class without any other arguemts will give you a list of
currently banned sites/races/classes.
Type can either be a level or one of the following keywords: all,newbie,mortal,
warn. If you set it to a level everyone equal to that level and below will not
be allowed on.  Warn, sends a warning to the Warn: channel that someone if
logging in from the site, with a certaing class or race.  If you add the
duration, the ban will expire in that many days. Sites can be banned with the *
wildcard as well.  Be carefull however as *.edu would ban everysite from .edu,
or *foo* would ban anysite that had the string foo in it.
BAN show, will print out the reason why that particular site/race or class was
banned and by who.  Number can be a class or race name, a site address or
you can use # followed by the ban number.
WARN will toggle the warn flag on a CURRENTLY banned site/class or race.

ALLOW site/race/class  <address/race/class>  removes a site, class or race from
the ban list.  This also can be allowed by using # syntax.

63 ANDROID ANDROIDS ANDROIDINFO~
&B==========================================================================&C
Androids are modified humans made by Dr.  Gero.  Due to their creator
they had evil intentions - at least Androids 17 and 18 did.  Another
(Android 16) was good, but he wasn't finished.  In the game this bears no
restriction, with all alignments being available to you.  As opposed to
having Ki energy like other fighters, Androids just have one big power
source inside them.  The downside to this in Dragonball Saga is a lack of
Ki dependant moves such as Final Flash and Instant Transmission.  However,
it does mean that physical attacks pack more punch.

-1 ANDROIDE~
&R=======================================================================
&wType E android. The E is short for Energy-absorbing.

This model of android does not need much explanation, really. Its name
says it all. These models are created around the soul purpose of
absorbing energy. The bodies of type E androids are somewhat of a hybrid
of type H and FM, however not in the way you may be thinking. Like FM,
the type E body is 100% mechanical; except that it isn't modular.
However, like type H, the android was originally a human. When the the
android body copy of the human is created, the brain of the human is
extracted from the human body, and implanted into the android body; thus
making them somewhat of a hybrid.

The main bodily feature of type E androids, aside from the see-thru
cranium with a human brain floating inside it, is the round crystal in
the palms of their hands. These nodes are what allow type E androids to
absorb ki energy. They can do so by touch, ie grabbing a person, by
which they are able to extract more energy, or by grabbing incoming ki
attacks and absorbing them instead. The ki absorb skill works the best
for type E androids, in that it has a 50% chance of working, as opposed
to type FM's chance of 35%. (type H gets no absorb skills at all).

Also unlike the other types, the type E android can eventually gain an
upgraded form of absorb. Like the upgraded shields, the upgraded absorb
skill overwrites the normal absorb skill permanently. So when you use
the normal absorb, and you have the upgraded form learned, it uses the
upgraded form instead. The normal form of absorb gives double tech level
gains for the damage it does, as well as draining 5% of the opponents
energy. However, the upgraded form gives tripple tech level gains for
its damage, and drains 10% of the opponents energy. The gains may seem
like a lot at first glance, but on the whole they really aren't. I
figured I'd throw this android type a bone anyways, seeing as they don't
get infinite energy like the type H, and they don't get the enhance
skills, among other downsides.

Type E androids can use all android eq like the other types can, as well
as use all tech level chips.

-1 ANDROIDFM~
&R=======================================================================
&wType FM android. The FM is short for Fully Mechanical. "OMIGAWD EFFEM
RAYDEEOH ANDROED LOLZ" Shut up, the joke has been done to death by now.

The FM type android in the game is partially based on android 16 from the
show, and then modified from there with how I think an android that is
100% pure machine and AI programming would be. Unlike the other android
types, the bodies of type FM androids can wildly fluctuate in design.
From more human-looking ones, such as android 16, to mechanical demons
right out your nightmares, such as Sigma.

One of the main consistencies in the FM types designs, however, is they
are largely modular-based, in that limbs and whatnot can be removed at
will, etc, which allows for their incredible versatility, and gave birth
to a number of their incredible attacks. One of the most commonly known
is rocket punch, whereby a type FM android can fire one of their arms
off like a rocket at an enemy, in order to do heavy damage.

The type FM android, unlike the other two types, is sort of a hybrid in
its own way, of its own race and the type E android. Like the type E,
the type FM has the capability to absorb ki energy. However, unlike type
E, type FM cannot gain upgraded forms of this technique, nor can it
store up and fire absorbed ki energy. The ki absorb skill for type FM
also has a slightly lower chance of working. Ie, type E's ki absorb has
a 50% chance, whereas type FM has a 35% chance.

Overall, the FM type is designed to be the 'strongest' type of android,
in regards to its literal strength, as well as its attacks; for the most
part, anyways.

Type FM androids are able to use all android eq, just like the other
android types, as well as all tech level chips.

-1 ANDROIDH~
&R=======================================================================
&wType H Android. The H is short for Human-based. (I would have used HB,
but then people would go OMIGAWD ANDO-HLAFY FOOSHIN WTF0RK?!/1shift-one).
These model of androids are perhaps one of the most misunderstood in all
of dbz.

True to its name, these Human-based androids start out as human beings.
Although the process is never explained or talked about in the show, I
have managed to piece together an explanation that makes a considerable
amount of sense. First, the human in question is put into a sleep. The
conciousness of the Human is then copied into a specialized super
computer; conciousness of course reffering to the network of electrical
pulses in the brain. The living body is then scanned, recording every
single detail of its physical structure, afterwhich it is disposed of.
Then, the android body is created. This body is created in a physical
likeness of the original human. However, it is entirely mechanical. The
android's body is made up of metal, circuits, etc etc. However. These
metals, computer chips, circuits, etc, are all composed out of synthetic
organic materials patterened after human cells (note the word patterned).
Because of this, the Android's body is capable of growing, and even
giving birth (in the case of android 18). Although these seem like odd
traits for a machine, you need to remember that they are still not human.
This design for the androids is also what allowed Cell to be able to
merge with Android 17 and 18 on a cellular level.

One of the key points to this androids design, is that because its
materials are organic, and loosely patterned after human cells, the
android is able to generate perpetual energy; meaning that the android
has infinite energy. Type H androids can continually use energy attacks,
etc, for as long as they want and they never have to worry about resting.
Nifty, eh?

Type H androids are also capable of using the techlevel chips designed
for androids, in order to modulate their tech level.

0 APPLY~
&B==========================================================================&C
To apply for an administrative position on the MUD you must have
played the MUD for at least 2 weeks before applying.  That way we
can get to know you as well as giving you time to learn how this
MUD works.

To apply after that time, post a message to the 'personal' message
board. A head builder or one of the owners of the MUD will read your
message within 24 hours.  They will then set up a time for an
interview with you.  The interview process must be in the presence
of at least one head builder and one owner, but any administrator
is welcome to take part in the interview.

During the interview you will be asked to describe to the interviewers
what experience you have in the position you are applying for.  If
you are applying for a building position then you will also be asked
to give the interviewers at least 2 ideas you have for new areas that
you could be assigned to build.  You will also be asked other questions
to determine how well you will perform your tasks if you were hired.

The position of a head builder can not be applied for as you did for
the position of a builder.  Before you can even be considered for a
position as a head builder you must have finished at least 2 new areas.
After that, the current head builders will begin to look at your

You can use 'appraise all' or appraise a certain item while at a repair
shop, where the scientist resides.  He'll tell you if it needs repair,
and if so, how much it will cost.

0 AREA AREAS~
&B===========================================================================&C
The 'areas' command displays an alphabetically sorted list of all areas
within the game, together with the author and suggested level range of
each area.

The 'areas old' command displays an unsorted list of all areas (the old
style), as well as the author and suggested level range of each area.

You can specify a level range to see a list of all areas with suggested
ranges which encompass the argument.  This can be a little awkward as
each area has a low and a high suggested range.  Suffice to say that if
an area's level range matches even one level of the range you request,
it will be displayed.

0 ARMOR~
&B=========================================================================&C
Just like in the show, and on most MUDs, you can buy or find armor
on DBS.  Based on a system with a max armor rating of ten thousand,
armor will absorb damage for you during fights.  As it does so, it
will take damage and need repairs.

52 ARMORCLASS~
.
&gThere are two values used with armor class for object type Armor:

&GValue0: Variable amount based on level of item at repop.
Value1: Maximum repairable armor setting for the object.

&gSetting Value0 has no effect. It will re-adjust itself on repop based on
the repop level of the item. Setting Value1 below the expected repop value
for Value0 will result in an item that cannot be repaired until Value0 drops
below Value1's setting. The listing below gives you a rough approximation of
the values returned for Value0 based on level:

&GLevel Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0
-------------   ------   -------------   ------   -------------   ------
      1           1-3         10           3-5         20           6-8
     30           8-10        40          11-13        50          13-15

&gThe amount that Value0 is set to determines the amount the player's A.C. will
be adjusted.

0 AUC AUCTION~
&B===========================================================================&C
The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing auction
will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one.
If nothing is being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will
begin an auction.  If no starting value is specified, it begins at 0 gold.
If nobody has bid on your auction once it ends, you will be charged 5% of
your starting value, so be careful!

Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item.
At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both
your bidded money and the item.  This will at some point be fixed.

You may see your Auction Limit in the Config menu.  Auctions for items with a
powerlevel requirement of less than this number shall be ignored.  You set
this by typing 'auction limit #'.  If you bid on an auction below this PL,
you will see the rest of the auction.  The same will happen if you put an
item up for bid that is below your limit.  However, these actions tend to change
your Auction Limit to match the items being auctioned.

&Y* Auctions will not be stopped for overbidding or misbidding *&C

&CSee Also:  &WAUCTION2 CONFIG
~

0 AUCTION2~
&B==================================================================================&C
Auction will also work with the following arguments:

au bid 20k      - bids 20000 coins
au bid 20k500   - bids 20500 coins (20,000 + 500)
au bid 20k5003  - bids 20500 coins, too (only checks first 3 chars after "k")
au bid 1m       - bids 1 million coins

On an existing bid of 10000:
au bid +10       - adds 10%, making the bet 11000.
au bid +         - adds 25% (the default if no number given), bet is 12500.
au bid x         - multiplies by 2, making the bet 20000.
au bid x5        - multiplies by 5, making the bet 50000.

All player files are scaned once a day to determine if they have been
inactive for too long.  The current auto-deletion of 'newbie' players
(those players under 1,000 PL) takes place after 1 week (7 days) of
inactivity.  The auto-deletion of all other players takes place 3 months
(90 days) of inactivity.  Administrators will not be subject to these
auto-deletes.

51 'BAN 50'~
&C
Seeking to ban a site above level 1 should be an extremely rare situation. One
in which the actions of one or more key persons from a site are deemed to be
a detriment to the enjoyment of a large portion of the players in the game.
Such person(s) are generally deemed to be beyond rehabilitation at this time.

When seeking to ban a site, make use of the Grub command to both see the impact
of the ban, and to get a list of all character names from the site. You can use
this list to keep an eye out for these characters coming in from other sites,
as it's obvious these days that a site ban may not always cure the situation.

All site bans above level one should be set at level 50 or higher. It should be
a rare instance in which a site is banned at some in between level. Only in the
direst of instances would a site be banned above level 50, as this will affect
immortal level players as well.

See also: 'BAN ALLOW' 'BAN NEWBIE' 'BAN DURATION'
~

51 'BAN DURATION'~
&C
The standard set for ban durations are as follows:

Newbie Ban:          1) One week on first instance.
                     2) Two weeks for the second.
                     3) One month at newbie, or level 50 for third.
                     4) Permanent at newbie, or level 50 for 4th offense.

Bans for level 2-50: 1) One month for first instance.
                     2) Two months, or permanent for 2nd.
                     3) Permanent for 3rd offense.

All bans above level 50 should be permanent by their very nature.

&WReminder - Without documenting each time we ban a site, we will have no
           source of history on sites. Always remember to post a note
           detailing the reasons for the ban.&C

~

51 'BAN NEWBIE'~
&C
Banning a site is a form of last resort, as it not only affects the offending
player or players, but will also affect every other player from that site.
Before seeking to ban a site, even for a temporary level 1 banning, make
sure you have exhausted all other options first.

In the case of newbie bans, most such instances arise through the actions of
one or more abusive players who log in a newbie and begin swearing, spamming,
threatening, etc.. Many times this has developed from an immature player's
frustrations over getting a name authed. If you find a player going through a
series of silly names trying to auth them, make every effort to try and talk
with them first. If this fails, use Fquit to discourage them. If you have
Disconnect, use this instead, as it is less provoking than fquit (makes it
appear as if they simply lost their conneection). If they continue their
efforts, send them warnings to get their attention. Use freeze if you have it
(or if someone else is on who can use it) to get their attention and make sure
received the message. Then, and only then, once you've exhausted all avenues
at being civil, you can use ban in good conscience. You've given the player(s)
every chance to cease their actions and given them fair warning over the fact
that if they continue they risk getting banned.

58 BARENUM BARESIZE~
&C
Syntax: mset <mob> barenum <number>
mset <mob> baresize <num>

These mob fields control the mobs ability to fight without weapons.
Barenum is the low end of the damage done and baresize is the multiplier.
For example: barenum 10 and baresize 5 would have the effect of allowing
the mob to hit barehanded for 10-50 damage.

* This field also affects experience gained.
Experience is calculated as follows:
^level 3*5 + max_hit +barenum *baresize +damroll * 50
+hitroll *ch -> level *10
~

1 BASHING~
&B==========================================================================&C
Bashing is loosely defined as: unnecessarily insulting a person or group
of people with intent of doing harm or causing humiliation.  It can also be
defined similarly to harassment if an insult is repeated over and over.  As
with any verbal communication, it is up to the recipient to determine if he
or she has been bashed.  Have a log handy to show the admins when you
report it.

And remember that bashing =/= constructive criciticm.  Admins have the
authority to decide whether or not you have been criticized or bashed.  But
a rule if thumb is that if you're calling someone a name (or other insult),
you're bashing, while if you're telling them to stop doing something,
you're probably criticizing.

Bashing can occur on channels, in private, or on boards.  And it can be
directed at anything relating to the person(s).  Quite common to Saga has
been RP-related bashing on the boards and on channels.

Examples of bashing:
"You're a mother f*cker." (This would be compound swearing and bashing.)
"Go suck a big donkey dick you homo." (Bashing, potentially harassment.)

Not examples:
"Your RP really sucks."
"Quit being a bastard."

1 BATTERY~
&R=======================================================================
&wThe Battery skill is unique to the type E android race. This skill
builds upon the capabilities of the ki absorb ability, by first allowing
an android to store up some of the damage absorbed from ki attacks. If
an android has this skill learned, a "Stored Ki Energy: [###]" gauge will
now show up on the player's score sheet. An android can store up to 100
points of ki energy. Once it reaches this maximum capacity, it stops
storing energy. Storing energy from absorbed ki attacks is a passive
thing, and happens automaticly. Once an android has successfully absorbed
some ki energy, the android can then use the battery command to unleash
this stored energy on its opponent. The damage it does depends on how
much energy is stored. The damage is a random number from 2/3rds of the
amount stored, to the amount stored. Battery takes 25 focus to use, and
completely depletes the stored ki energy stat when used.

0 BERSERK~
&B==========================================================================&C
This tactic is truly powerful, for it causes the fighter to allow pure
rage to flow through him, at the cost of his own judgement and care for
his or her well-being. While the berserked fighter will strike deeper
into an enemies' flesh, his foes will be able to take advantage and bury
their weapons deeper into the berserker.

60 BESTOW BESTOWMENTS~
&C
Syntax: bestow <victim> command [command] [command] etc
bestow <victim> list
bestow <victim> none

Bestow is used to give a command to a player that the player would not normally
have. Bestow victim command will give the command to the person, bestow victim
list will show all commands corrently bestowed on the person, and bestow victim
none will remove all bestowments.
~

55 BESTOWAREA~
&C
Syntax: bestowarea <victim> <filename>.are

This command allows members of the Area Council to bestow area names
to immortals so that they can engage in group building.

Once an AC member bestows a proto area on a player, that player can
use the aassign command to assign themselves that proto area in order
to help the owner of the proto area.

Examples:

bestowarea joe bob.are           allows joe to work on bob's proto area
bestowarea joe                   lists all of joe's bestowed areas
bestowarea joe list              ditto
bestowarea joe none              removes all of joe's bestowed areas

0 BIGBANG BB~
&B=======================================================================&C
A technique as explosive as its namesake, Big Bang creates a very
large 'bomb' of ki.  Any opponent on the receiving end of this attack
will rue the day the universe was created.  Big Bang requires 1000
energy and 20 focus to fire.

their foe.  It costs 2000 energy and 45 focus to utilize this
extremely powerful technique.

0 BIO DESC DESCRIPTION~
&B==========================================================================&C
The 'description' command puts you into an editor to edit your character
description (what people see when they look at you).

The 'bio' command puts you into an editor to edit your personal bio, which is
what people see when they use 'finger' or 'whois' on you.

An Immortal can request you change your description or bio if it contains
inappropriate material.  Do not use profanity, racial slurs, sexual comments,
other players names (without their permission), or off-color remarks.  Refusal
to change your bio, description, or title on Immortal request is grounds for
loss of character privileges.


Bio is short for Biography, which is a glimpse into some part of your
character's life.  This glimpse helps to shed light on why your character
has the personality you're using while roleplaying.

This bio is what others will use as a starting point for "first contact"
when dealing with your character, so it should be crafted to make a good
first impression.

So, what do you need to do to get your Bio authed?

Here are the &Wminimum&C requirements needed to have your bio authed.

* Must be at least 200 words long
* Must be free of misspelled words
* Must be relatively free of grammar mistakes
* Must be well-formatted (use of format command is recommended)
* Fulfils one of the following:
  * Describes your childhood
  * Describes an important event that helped shape your personality
  * Paints a vivid picture of your personality/goals/motives

In addition to these, it is strongly suggested that your bio also fulfill
the following:

* Lists any family members who may take part in roleplaying
* Gives a short description of your character, including age

And here is a list of things to &Wavoid&C in your bio.  Putting them in
doesn't mean your bio won't be authorized, it just means that it'll have to
be extra good before we'll think about it.

* Names of DB/DBZ/DBGT characters
* "My parents were killed by ...."
* "I'm seeking revenge on ..."
* Training with and/or possession of weapons
* Techniques for which there are no skills/abilities currently coded

Once you have written your bio use the 'reqbioauth' command to have it
queued for authorization.  Please do not ask/beg/pester the Admin to look
at your bio, we will do our best to get to it as quickly as possible.

This is not an exhaustive and all-encompassing list, and as such there may
still be things in your bio that will cause us to deny it.  When your bio
is denied you will receive a message stating why it was denied.  Keep in
mind that the message comes through like any other message, and if you're
in the middle of something spammy you'll probably miss it.  Because of that
we'll do our best to notify someone when we're going to review their bio
so that they will be able to reduce their spam and see any messages that
may be sent to them.

Last, and certainly not least, once your bio has been authed please do not
make any changes to it.  If things with your character change then use the
RP board and/or the web site to chronicle the continuing life and times of
your character.
~

-1 BIO-ANDROID BIOANDROID~
&B=============================================================================&C
Another of Dr. Geros creations.  All bio-androids start out like a blank slate.
All that they have been programmed with are some basic fighting techniques and
the knowledge that to become the perfect being they must use their powerful
tail to absorb their victims.

Bio-androids do not learn like the other races.  They must absorb knowledge
from their victims.  When a bio-android absorbs someone learn what their
victim knew.  This is how a bio-android learns skills and abilities.  They
can learn almost all the skills and abilities that the other races have.
The only things they can't learn are racial transformations and the other
races most powerful attacks.  Most skills and abilities will be learned
by killing other players, how ever the basic skills can be absorbed from
some mobs.

While fighting, bio-androids don't gain very much power level because they
were not created to become stronger by fighting.  At the end of each fight
bio-androids will absorb their victims and gain the power level that wasn't
gotten by combat.  As more and more victims are absorbed the more takes on
the abilities of those races.  Even to the point that they can begin to
gain power level at the same rate as other races.

Bio-androids are one of the best pk races, if not the best.

1 BLASTZONE~
&R=======================================================================
&wBlast zone is a technique used by 17 and 18 in the 'Trunks special'
movie. When they figured they had lost track of Gohan after a fight in
an amusement park, but suspected he might still be nearby, they both
raised one arm up, palm facing upward, and released a sudden, intense
blast of energy that decimated the area, and Gohan at the same time;
causing him to lose his left arm. While the attack in this game won't
make your opponents lose their arms, it will do some pretty decent
damage. Blast zone costs 800 energy, 25 focus, and can be charged. Only
type H androids get this technique.

0 BOTTING~
&B========================================================================&C
Botting is when a player is using triggers, scripts, or an external
program to completely automate the actions of his or her character. Players
usually use this technique to gain power level, zeni, or items while he or
she is away from their computer so that they can have an advantage over
legitimate players.  Botting IS a form of cheating, and we punish cheaters
very harshly.

Administrators have many ways to detect if a player is botting.  One of the
most simple ways for admins to detect a botter is to, simply, ask. If you
do not respond to 'tells' by an admin and your character has not turned on
their 'AFK' flag it will be assumed you are botting and you will be
punished.

Note that a player does not necessarily have to be away from his or her
keyboard to be considered a 'bot.' So long as you're using any form of
triggers and/or timers to kill mobs, you are botting.

Also note that we will test for triggers before we punish. So if you have
been punished for botting, then your trigger has been found out, and
whining about claiming to be innocent will get you no where.

For further information about aliases, triggers and such, please read 'HELP
ALIAS'.

0 BOUNTY~
&B==========================================================================&C
Syntax: bounty <amount> <player>
Syntax: bounty all      <player>
Syntax: bounty collect
Syntax: bounty check    <player>
Syntax: bounty check
Syntax: bounty buy
Syntax: bounty who
Syntax: bounty hunt (player) (pay)

Bounty <amount> <player> sets a bounty worth <amount> gold on a players
head to be collected by whomever kills that player. It can not be set
on a fighter in training.

Bounty all <player> sets a bounty worth all of the gold you have on the
head of that player.

Bounty collect is to collect on bounties that you have claimed from the
heads of other players.

Bounty check <player> is to check the value of a players bounty.

Bounty check is the only command that can be used when not in the
presence of a bounty officer. This tells you the value of any bounty
on your head as well as how much bounty you have claimed, and are owed,
if any.

Bounty buy will let you buy the bounty on your head so that no one
can collect it.  This will cost 2x the price of the bounty.

Bounty who will tell you who put the bounty on your head.  This
will cost half the price of the bounty.

Bounty hunt will show you a list of everyone who is online who has
a bounty on them and the reward.

Bounty hunt (player) (pay) is how you accept the hunt for a player.
If you only type the players name then it will tell you how much the
'service fee' is for taking that bounty.  Use 'pay' to confirm.

58 BSET BSTAT~
&C
Syntax: Bset <board filename> <field> <value>
Syntax: Bstat <board filename> (same room as board needs no args)

BSTAT will show the current setting for the statted board.

BSET will set new values for a given board.
Correct FIELD values for Bset are:
  ovnum, read, post, remove, maxpost, filename, and type
  read_group, post_group, extra_readers, and extra_removers
  All boards will be type 1, except Nerif's mail board (type 2).
Action FIELD values include:
  oremove, otake, olist, oread, ocopy, opost, and postmessg
  These should be followed by the message to be sent to those
  who are at the board, but not performing the action (similar
  to mpechoaround). Postmessg is the only message that will be
  seen by the actor of a Bset action value.

0 BUILDER~
&B==========================================================================&C
As a builder you have more responsibilities than a play tester
since you have a higher position on the MUD.  Your responsibilities
are as follows in the order of priority:

&W *&C To Work on the projects assigned to you by a head builder.

 &W* &CTo administer other players by answering questions.

You may always ask a head builder for assistance when you need it.

~

51 BUILDING GUIDELINES~
&CHere are some building guidelines by Koronto. Please follow these when
building all areas. :)

&YRoom Descs:
&CThe absolute minimum desc size for rooms is three lines. (Only if there are
a bunch of unimportant rooms with all unique descs. Some may have three
lines. The rest need at least four, preferably five.)
Rooms of any importance need descs of at least five lines. More is better.
Do not describe mobs in room descs. If the mob isn't there, then the room
desc will make no sense. You may, however, describe "mobs" that aren't
actually mobs. (Like a crowd of people in a busy intersection)
If the player would ever reasonably want to interact with such a "virtual"
mob, then make it a real mob and take it out of the room desc.

&YMob Descs:
&CALL mobs must have a desc of at least two lines. Important mobs need more.
Don't describe actions that the mob is performing, unless the mob does the
action constantly. (Literally without pause)
(I'm talking about the desc of "mset mob description", not the longdesc)

&YObj Descs:
&CIf an object is totally unimportant, and it needs no further description
than its short desc, it doesn't need a desc. Otherwise, it needs a desc.
(If the player will not know what the object actually is from the short
desc, it MUST have a desc.) If in doubt, give it a desc.
(To set obj descs, use "oset object ed keyword1 keyword2 keyword3 ..."
All these keywords will view the same desc. You can set more ed's if you want
players to be able to examine specific parts of an object)

&YGeneral desc guidelines:
&CIn descs, do not force actions on the player. Don't describe emotions that
the character is feeling, and don't say what the character wants to do.
Do not tell a 'story' with your descs. The desc should be a static
description. If a player has been sitting in a room for 10 minutes and looks
at the desc, it needs to make sense. To describe events, use progs instead.
If in doubt about whether to give something a desc, or as to the length of
a desc, go for making it longer.

&YGeneral mob guidelines:
&CDo not make instarepopping mobs. This includes mobs that can be created by
players at will. (with speech progs, etc) There may be exeptions for certain
quests, but make sure that the mob has good enough stats to make it not
worth fighting for PL.

Set appropriate stats and fight progs on ALL non pacifist mobs! Don't ever
let players fight mobs with the default 10 stats (Unless you're making a
100-pl area ;P) The same goes for progs. Mobs past the pl where melee
becomes useless MUST have energy attacks. (Or mppldamage attacks)
Otherwise they are no challenge to kill whatsoever. Most mobs should have
at least one fight prog at 40% or higher. (Albeit a weak one)

For hi-pl mobs (or low-pl ones that you want to be especially challenging),
be sure to set the damdie to significant values. (Also possibly the hitdie.)
This lets melee attacks actually hit and actually do damage.

&YGeneral object guidelines:
&CObjects gotten from quests should be better than objects dropped from
mobs. Objects dropped from mobs should be better than items sold in stores.
~

0 BURNINGATTACK BA~
&B========================================================================&C
This attack is mostly considered a 'distraction', something to shoot
at your enemy while gathering focus to let loose a larger attack.  The
user thrashes their hands through the air wildy, before firing a small
ball of 'burning' energy.  It uses only 15 focus and 700 energy.

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
&B==============================================================================&C
Syntax: buy   <object/#>
Syntax: buy   <# of object> <object/#>
Syntax: list
Syntax: list  <object>
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
BUY <# of object> <object> will allow you to buy up to twenty of a normal
store item at once.

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.  LIST <object> lists
just the objects with that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

~

1 CALLSHIP~
Syntax: callship [list/ship name]

This command will call your ship back to you when you've left it
some where else.  You must be at a normal docking port and your
ship has to be docked some where.  The callship command will not
return a ship that flying around somewhere.

A scouter is required to communicate with your ship, unless your
and android as they already have communication systems built in.

'Callship list' will list all the ships you own or can pilot as well
as where they are in the universe.

'Callship <ship name>' will call back the ship you specify.
~

61 CEDIT~
&C
Syntax:  cedit save
Syntax:  cedit <command> create [code]
Syntax:  cedit <command> delete
Syntax:  cedit <command> show
Syntax:  cedit <command> [field]

Field being one of:
  level position log code

Cedit create is used to create the entry and name for a new command.
Cedit delete is used to delete a command.
Cedit code is used to assign a defined section of code to a command.
Cedit show displays current statistics on a command.
Cedit level sets the minimum level for usage of a command.
Cedit position sets the min_pos for execution of the command.
Cedit log determines the manner in which the command will be logged.

Use 'cedit save' to save changes permanently.

12 CHAMPION~
&B==========================================================================
&RCongratulations!  You have achieved the '&BChampion&R' rank!&C

Your rewards for reaching this incredible level is:

 * 'Bless' command

If your ranking drops below the Champion rank, you will lose this ability
until your rank goes back up to the Champion rank.

Hardcore characters will also recieve these bonuses, but they will still
be listed under the 'Unknown' rank.

~

55 CHAN SAVE~
&CSAVE saves your character and its inventory.  The system automatically saves
approximately one character every minute, but with the high number of players
usually online it may take hours before your own is auto-saved.  For this
reason, you should not rely on auto-save to keep your character updated.

Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.

Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.  You cannot SAVE and QUIT
with objects of a higher level than your own, as they will vanish when
you log out.  Every character is auto-saved at reboot.

         ::> Sweet! I figured out how to add new fields to the PFile with out
                screwing up the mud.  I added PL, MaxPrac, Train, MaxTrain
                fields. Now current PL is linked to PL and not Max_Move, and
                your training points are linked to Train and not Move.
         ::> "Levels" are now set up so you can gain energy, pracs and trains

1 CHANGESTATUS~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clan leaders change alliance status towards another clan via the
clanadmin command. The syntax is:

       clanadmin status <clan name> <new status>

Clan alliances cannot be changed on a whim. Whenever you change
status towards another clan there is a short pause before that takes
effect, and, a minimum time that status will be in effect before it
can be changed again. For example, clan A cannot quickly declare
themselves hostile, pk someone, then declare themselves friendly
again.

Whenever a clan leader changes status, both clans will receive an
announcement telling them what the status is changing to and when it
will be effective. They will receive another announcement when the
new status becomes effective.

The 'claninfo' command shows, for each clan, their current outlook on
that clan, that clan's outlook towards them, and if applicable what
the next outlook will be and how long until it takes effect. It will
also show any time remaining before the current status can be
changed.

'all' option, CHANNELS will turn on/off all normal channels.

Public channels are those that can be seen by everyone, regardless of their
affiliation with clans, guilds, orders or councils.  Private channels are

1 CHARGE~
&B=============================================================================&C
Syntax: charge <attack>

Charging is a way to channel more energy in to an attack to make it more
affective and damaging to your enemy.  To begin to charge an attack you
must first learn how to charge by practicing 'Charge L1'.  Learning this
skill will allow you to charge an attack 1 time.  Each additional charge
level learned you will be able to charge your attack 1 extra time.

While charging you will stop fighting and be put into a 'charge buffer'.
You will leave the 'charge buffer' when one of the following happens:

* You enter a command (this will cause you to fire your attack at the
  level that it is currently charged up to)
* You fail at charging your attack to the next level (this will cause
  the attack to fire at the level you made it to before failing)
* You successfully charge your attack to your current max charge level

Some energy attacks may even require you to charge them to a certain level
before you can even use them.

Charging attacks takes 50% of the focus cost of the attack you are charging
every time you charge it and the FULL energy requirement.

0 CHAT ASK ANSWER SHOUT YELL OOC~
&B===========================================================================&C
These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.
SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

CHAT, OOC, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all interested
players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The ASK and ANSWER commands
both use the same 'question' channel

Syntax:  chat [option] <message>
the [Chat] channels options and an example of what it looks like
when brodcast are as follows:

chat <message>
[Chat] Goku: 'So you have finaly arrived I see...'
chat * <message>
[Chat] Goku shakes his head.

&B===============================================================================&C
Since Androids have no ki to power up their stored combat data -- which
expands their system and adds 'Tech Level' -- and hardware upgrades are what
makes them become more powerful.  The good Doctor has also created special
computer chips that can be installed inside of Androids to multiply their
Tech Level.  There are rumors of a series of prototype chips that Dr. Gero
installed into some of his creations, but few -- if any -- have ever been

0 CLAN CLANS~
&B========================================================================&C
Clans are a group of players following a common theme or goal and are
a very important part of DragonBall Saga. Clans have many features
not commonly found among other worlds including a clan tax rate to
help clans finance their development, their own recall rooms, their
own jails, their own donation rooms, clan bank accounts into which
members can deposit gold, clan only skills, clan transporters, clan
healing rooms and hospitals, clan ATM machines, clan guards and clan
exits to some of the harder places in the mud to reach.

Joining a clan is not something to be undertaken lightly, once in a
clan the only way to leave is to become an outcast (see help
outcast).

To see more information on each clan, type 'help [clan name]'.

Other clan related commands are:

CLANS      : See a list of all clans.
CLANDEPOSIT: For members to deposit gold into their clan bank account.
CLANADMIN  : Leader's command to recruit/promote/demote members.
CLANINFO   : Show rankings and leaders of a clan.
MEMBERWHERE: Clan leaders can type 'memberwhere' to see location of
             their members.

0 CLANALLIES ALLIES ALLIANCES ALLIANCE~
&B===========================================================================&C
DragonBall Saga has a fairly complicated clan alliance system where
every clan may have an 'outlook' towards every other clan. Your
clan's alliance status towards another clan determines what actions
you may perform regarding that clan.

To see the alliance status of your clan, or another clan, use:

      claninfo <clan name>

The outlook you have towards another clan does not necessarily
determine that clan's outlook towards you. For example, clan A can be
hostile towards clan B, while clan B can still be friendly towards
clan A if they so choose (for example, as an act of peace). Some clan
outlooks however have to be mutual before they are fully effective.
The clan alliance status types and what each allows or restricts are:

Neutral
&B--------&C
Default clan status. Clans can PK but cannot raid or defend.

Friendly
&B--------&C
If your clan is friendly towards another clan, you cannot PK members
of that clan. This does not restrict that clan in the same way unless
they are also friendly towards your clan. You cannot raid a clan that
you are friendly towards, but again, this does not apply both ways.

Allied
&B--------&C
For this to be active, both clans have to set each other as allied,
otherwise it is considered the same as "friendly". If you are allied
with a clan, all attributes of the "friendly" status apply, plus, you
may help that clan defend against raiders and, during a raid, their
guards will not attack you.

Hostile
&B--------&C
If your clan is hostile towards another clan, you may take part in
raids on that clan. This does not apply the other way around unless
that clan is also hostile towards you.

At War
&B--------&C
For this to be active, both clans have to set each other as "at war",
otherwise it is considered the same as hostile. "At war" status is
open PK mud-wide between the two clans involved. Two leaders from
each clan have to declare 'at war' status. If only one leader has
declared wars so far, the 'clanallies' command will show that
leader's name.

50 CLANEQ CLANEQUIPMENT CLANITEM~
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
&C
Clan EQ is a clan's special equipment that all the members of a clan
get for free. The quality of a clan's eq is determined by how much zeni
that clan spends on the eq. All clans get one piece of EQ for free, but
it doesn't do anything. Clans must spend zeni to add stat bonuses or armor
to their EQ. The way it works is as follows:

Each stat is bought seperately. The base price for a +1 stat mod is
2.5 million zeni. To add a second +1 to the same stat it costs an
additional 5mil zeni (twice 2.5). To add a third +1 to that stat would
cost an additional 10mil zeni (twice 5) and so on.
Since each stat is seperate, if you were to buy a +1 to all four stats,
it would cost your clan 10mil zeni. (2.5 * 4)
A +2 to all stats would cost 30mil zeni. ( (2.5 + 5) * 4)

Armor works similarly. The first 10 armor on an item costs 100k. The second
10 armor costs an additional 200k, and the next 10 armor costs an additional
400k. The cap is 100 armor per item (Which would cost about 51mil)

You may upgrade any piece of clan eq at any time, by just paying the
appropriate cost for the additional stat bonus(es). You may not downgrade
EQ after upgrading it.

If you want more that one piece of EQ, it gets slightly more
complicated. The base price for the second piece of EQ (instead of being
free) is 5mil. The base price for the third piece is 10mil, and it's
20mil for the fourth, etc. The stat prices start over at 2.5mil on a
new clan item, so there are advantages and disadvantages to having
more than one piece of EQ. Each piece of clan eq must take up a
different slot on the body (such as neck, body, about, etc) and may
not layer with other eq. (as, for example, aura and bio-synth layer)

Prices for clan EQ increase the more people are in a clan. For each member
of the clan (according to the 'clans' command at the time of the purchase)
past 15 members, the price of EQ transactions is increased by 2%.
In other words, if a clan has 65 members, they pay 200% of the base price.

Locations that you may not use for clan eq include the following:
Shield, light, hold, and back.

You may use the "wield" slot, so your item is a weapon, but to do this will
cost an additional 100mil zeni at the time of item creation.

RPP (role-playing points) may be used while purchasing clan EQ. The exchange
rate is 10 RPP = 1mil zeni. (as compared to 25 RPP = 1mil zeni for straight
RPP to cash transactions)
You may pay using a mix of RPP and zeni, but no more than half the price of
the item/upgrade may come from RPP. The other half (or more) must be zeni.

To make any of these changes, contact an immortal ranked "Head Builder"
or higher. The only current active immortal who will be doing this is
Koronto.

0 CLANLEADER CLANLEADERS CLANADMIN~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&B========================================================================&C
Clan leaders in DragonBall Saga have many responsibilities, and thus
have been given commands, described below. Also included are some
notes about clan leaders.

Each clan must have two clan leaders. If the leadership is reduced to
one, this should be remedied asap.

A clan leader can be removed by the vote of the other clan leaders,
or at the request of the leader him/herself. Adding a leader costs
the clan 15,000,000. Removing a leader costs nothing.
Leaders get their own channel. It is called ltalk, and can be used
with ltalk or lt.

Clanadmin
&B-----------&C
Syntax: clanadmin [www|recruit|outcast|promote|demote|taxrate|jail|
                   release|evict|evictrank|status]

www         - Changes the web address in claninfo

0 CLEAR~
&C
Syntax: clear

This command clears the screen.

See PAGELENGTH.
~

1 CLEAVER~
&R=======================================================================
&wThis attack never really existed in DBZ, but its a fitting addition to
the demonic arsenal. Harnassing its evil power, a demon creates a black,
spinning disc of energy overhead, similar to the DDD's used by Icers,
that can be hurled at their enemies and cause considerable damage. Like
DDD, Cleaver has a chance to instantly kill a person; cutting them in
half. Cleaver costs 400 energy, and takes 18 focus.

~

51 CLIMATE~
&C
Syntax climate <field> <name>

This command allows you to view or modify the climate
settings for an area. There are settings for temperature,
precipitation, and wind. In addition, you may specify
neighboring areas who will affect changes in the current
areas weather. Therefore there are four fields to choose
from. Each field has a different range of values available.

Field name:           Values:
temp                  cold, cool, normal, warm, hot
precip                arid, dry, normal, damp, wet
wind                  still, calm, normal, breezy, windy
neighbor              <area name>

Specifying an area name with neighbor which is already on
the list will remove it. Using climate without any arguments
will display the area's current setting. Note that this
command always refers to the area which you are currently in.
~

1 CLONE BIOJR "BIO JR"~
&R=======================================================================
&wThe knowledge of how to perform this technique is buried and sealed in the
minds of all bio-androids upon their creation.  Once a Bio-Android has long
since achieved its ultimate form, this knowledge becomes unlocked, and it
enables the Bio-android to create between 5 and 10 clones of itself, using
its own energy.  Clone has a 75bil pl requirement, and costs 2k energy per
clone to use.  When practiced, you automaticly get this skill at 100%.
Each clone has 1/(#)th of your current pl, where # is the number of clones
you create.  So if you create 5 clones, each will have 1/5th of your
current.  If you create 7, 1/7th of your current, etc etc.

&RThe clone command is currently restricted to a maximum of 5, until
further notice. &w

51 CODEBUGS~
-Crash Bugs
* double check the instant transmission code for
  "lock ups" in the looping code.  this is one of
  the last "freeze the mud" bugs
* crash proof eof pfile reads.  maybe come up with
  a way to test each pfile to make sure it's complete
  before it's loaded.  code from the pfile_scan might
  help here.
-Other Bugs/Fixes Needed
* silence time to real time not online ticks (easy)
* pDef and eDef (i think the forumulas are there
  they just arn't affecting anything for some reason)
* mppldamage (any non-working mob prog should always
  be fixed ASAP)
* edit buffer replace command (as much as everyone might
  love to annoy viola, this really does need to be fixed)
* stop preservation from droping people in empty rooms

which will set it to the current color in the mud scheme for that
location.

~

51 COLORS~
&C
The ability to color Help and other files is very useful. We ask
that you try to stick to these guidelines for color usage so that
we can have some consistency in their use:

Here are some outlines for using color on a white text file:
  &CHelp (Filename) &Wcolored cyan.
  &GLaws (Law) &WColored green.
  &PAttacker/Killer/Thief &Wcolored pink.
  &GOrder/Guild (Order/Guild) &Wcolored green.
  &RClans (Clan) &Wcolored red.
  &YSyntax  &Wfor sytax references, colored yellow.
  &CDeities (Deity) &Wcolored cyan.
  &RDeadly/Dealies &Wcolored red.
  &YConfig (+/- option) &Wcolored yellow.
&C
If you wish to add other colors to your file, please use good
taste, make sure it is readable and don't get too whacky. If
you follow the above guidelines and stick to using white for
all other text, it will keep the text solid and legible. Should
you choose not to use any colors at all, that is also okay, the
above guidlines are merely for proper use of color, white is
always acceptable.

In addition, please keep in mind that the following topics should
not be colored except by their defaults:
  - Help (area name)
  - Help (skill)
  - Help (spell)
  - Help (class)
~

0 COMBAT~
&B=============================================================================&C
Combat is the basis of this game, as makes sense for something based off the
various Dragon Ball series.  To enter combat, just type 'kill <name>' of the
mob you wish to kill.  To kill a person (PKing/Player Killing) you must type
'kill <name> now'.  Once you have entered combat, you have many options.
You could switch styles to give yourself an advatage, or use various physical
and energy attacks by merely typing out their names.  You could even 'flee',
if you think a fight might not go your way.

There is also the combat command, which works much like the config command.  To
use it either type just combat, or combat {+|-}<option>, to set or remove the
specific toggle.  These toggles affect how your character reacts in combat, to
some extent.

   KIABSORB      (Androids only) When set you'll attempt to absorb Ki Attacks.

0 COMMANDS SOCIALS~
&C&B============================================================================&C
Syntax:  commands <string>

COMMANDS shows you all the (non-social) commands available to you.  If you
include a string you see all available commands that begin with that string.

SOCIALS shows you all the social commands available to you.

51 COMMENT~
&C
Syntax: comment write
Syntax: comment subject <subject>
Syntax: comment post <player>
Syntax: comment list <player>
Syntax: comment read <player> #
Syntax: comment remove <player> #


Comment write puts you into a buffer, and the commands work just like writing
a note.  You may only read and post comments on players currently online.

Comments should be used for all disciplinary actions and warnings, on anyone
who makes frequent demands of or troubles for immortals in general even if
the player is not doing something specifically illegal, repeated problems,
after _all_ reimbursements, and any other information you feel would be
important to another Immortal when dealing with the player in the future.

If you have a disciplinary action and the player quits before you are able to
post a comment, please place a copy of the comment on the board located in
hell, room vnum 6.

Steps for using 'comment':
1) Type 'comment write'.  This will put you in an edit buffer.
2) Type in the information you wish to attach to a player.  Type
   '/s' and hit enter when you are finished.
3) Type 'comment subject <short descrption of the comment>'.
4) Type 'comment post <player>' to put the comment on the player.
~

53 COMPASS AUTOCOMPASS~
&B===========================================================================&C
Another function of a scouter is the ability to use its readout as a sort of
computerized map of the area.  This will show you a visual readout of what
directions have exits, as well as any doors you might be able to see.
Doors will show up as '#' signs on the map.  Type 'look compass' to see the
map, or turn on the 'autocompass' function in your 'config'.

&C
Concerns and complaints may be emailed to Goku (GokuDBS@hotmail.com).
Details are important, and logs (when not unduly log) are always best.

~

0 CON CONSTITUTION~
&B============================================================================&C
Constitution (CON in your 'score') represents your character's physical
stamina.  Constitution is used for the following things:

* Healing rate for all races
* Energy defence bonus (eDEF)
* Phycial defence bonus (pDEF)
* Determins how many energy points you get for each energy gain
* Heart power level multiplier for humans

1 CONDUCT~
&B==========================================================================&C
If someone asks you to stop swearing, you'd better do so under threat of a 
variable length silence.

Mudsex for money and/or equipment, or anything else, is illegal (really
people, have some damn morals).  Punishment for this will be removal of
both parties involved.

Spam is bad.

Respect an admin, or at least try to act like you do.  If some "load of 
shit" happened, send a note to an imm higher than the person that punished
you.  If you don't know, try Saiyr.

If an admin tells you do something concerning public discussion, etc., do 
it or die.&D
~

0 CONFIG~
&B===============================================================================&C
Syntax:  config + or - <option>

This command configures some of your character behavior.  Typing CONFIG
alone shows you your current settings.  With a plus or minus sign and
an option, CONFIG turns that option on or off.  The options are:

  AUTOEXIT  You automatically see exits
  AUTOLOOT  You automatically loot corpses (not on pkilled corpses)
  AUTOSAC   You automatically sacrifice corpses
  GAG       Toggle whether you see battle details in full or brief form
  PAGER     Toggle page pausing on long scrolls
  BLANK     You have a blank line before your prompt
  BRIEF     You see brief descriptions only.
  COMBINE   You see object lists in combined format
  NOINTRO   Toggle whether you see the graphic screen at login
  PROMPT    You have a prompt
  TELNTGA   You receive a telnet GA sequence
  ANSI      You receive ANSI color sequences
  RIP       You don't receive RIP graphics
  SWEAR     You can allow yourself to hear swears on various channels.
  WIMPY     You may set at what health you wish to automatically flee.
  AUCTION   Changes the minimum powerlevel of auctions you will see.
  NOFOLLOW  Tooggles whether you can be followed by other players.

0 CONTAINER CONTAINERS~
&B================================================================================&C
Containers are almost a necessity in DBS MUD.  They are used to carry
items, food, and drinks.  They help allow you to sort things, by using two
or more types of containers at once.  Corpses use many of the same commands
as regular containers.

EXAM <container> or LOOK IN <container> allows you to see what it contains.
GET <item> <container> allows you to take one item from a container.
PUT <item> <container> puts an item inside a container.

If there are multiple containers with the same name you can access them by
doing the following:

EXAM #.<container> or LOOK IN #.<container> allows you to see what it contains.
GET <item> #.<container> allows you to take one item from a container.
PUT <item> #.<container> puts an item inside a container.

Where # is the number of the container you wish to access.

0 CRASH~
&C&B============================================================================&C
Crashes are unforeseen interruptions in the game that cause everyone
to be disconnected. If you type time and look at the system start up
time, you can determine if the game has just rebooted or if it was a
problem with only your character.

99.9% of the time corpses will save over a crash. The game will
start back up with your character at the last place you saved or the
game saved you.

1 CRUISEPUNCH~
&R=======================================================================
&wA rather unconventional tactic of the android race, usable only by
type FM androids. The basis for this skill is simple, in that it follows
the saying "Discretion is the better part of valor." If an android finds
itself losing, or simply doesn't feel like fighting anymore, it can fire
its fist off at the opponent, however instead of doing damage, it grabs
the person by the face and throws them out of the room. The person will
continue to fly off in a straight line till they reach a room with no
more exits in that direction. Cruise punch costs 275 energy, and 15
focus to use. Cruise punch cannot be used on NPC's.

equasion for a mob... ie:  10d6 + 10   (the +10 is the damplus)
This "damplus" is always added, whether or not the mob is barehanded or
wielding a weapon.   This is basically the mob's damroll.

1 DARKNESSFLARE "DARKNESS FLARE"~
&R=======================================================================
&wAn ability originating from the Shadow Earth, Darkness Flare is the
opposite of Solar Flare, although it achieves pretty much the same
effect. Placing 3 fingers near to both sides of their face, a Demon
releases a burst of dark energy that floods an area with complete and
total darkness. This blinds everyone else in the immediate area, that
isn't able to see in the dark; thus, Darkness Flare has no effect on
other Demons, Androids, or Super Androids. After using this skill, the
Demon can make a quick and effective escape. Darkness Flare costs 1000
energy, and takes 20 focus.

0 DBZNAMES~
&B===============================================================================&C
1) Names from the show MUST have permission from the high-level Admin of the
   game.  Please do not ask the Admin for this permission.  Instead work and
   strive to show that you are an excellent roleplayer as well as a courteous,
   helpful, productive player of the game.  If you can do this then you will
   stand out from the rank and file and may very well be approached by the
   Admin with the prospect of playing one of the "named" characters.

2) No names of fused characters, such as Gotenks or Vegetto, or names that
   sound like they could be fused characters, such as Krillicollo or Gohanku.
   These names will automatically be denied and/or changed.

3) No spin-off or alternate spellings of main character names.  This means that
   names like ssjgoku, chibitrunks, Vegitta, etc. are all illegal.

4) Players who are granted the use of a name from the show will be held to a
   much higher standard than the normal player.  You will be expected to be
   even more vigilant when it comes to following all the rules of the game.
   You will also be expected to roleplay within the bounds of the character as
   they are set out in the show.  This means that you would not do things that
   are obviously "out of character" for a particular personality.  For example,
   if you were playing as Napa you wouldn't start wearing a wig with long hair
   and touting the principles of peace and love.

5) When you are granted a name from the show you will be expected to start the
   character from scratch.  You will not be allowed to rename an existing
   character.  You will also be expected to follow all the setup information
   for said character (i.e., if you get the name Piccolo you wouldn't create
   him as an Icer).  You also can not create the character as a Hardcore
   character.

0 DEATH~
&B===========================================================================&C
When your character dies, you are sent to the next dimension.  Your corpse
is left behind where you were killed, together with all of your equipment.
Your zeni stays with you (the gods want you to have your zeni).

You will also lose a small percentage of your powerlevel whenever you die.
You lose less whenever you are killed by another player, and certain skills
(like Preservation for Nameks) will lower how much powerlevel you lose.

Corpses decay after time.  When this happens the objects inside a corpse
will decay with it.  Player corpses last roughly 30 minutes of real time.
Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.  The only exceptions are for deadly characters,
who can loot each other's corpses at will.
~

0 DEATHBALL DB~
&B==========================================================================&C
Death Ball is the most powerful attack available to the Icer race,
useful not only for its sheer force.  Pointing a finger at their enemy,
the Icer creates a giant ball of energy that engulfs their foe.  This
attack has a chance to completely disintigrate its victim, no
matter their powerlevels.

This attack costs 1000 energy and 35 focus to properly perform.

Type 'style defensive' to assume a defensive style of combat.

dodging. An effective fighter will take less damage from an enemy, but not
as much as one using evasive tactics. A fighter will also do less damage to
enemies, but slightly greater than those who simply evade.

~

-1 DEMON~
&R=======================================================================
&wDemons originate from an opposite dimension of Earth, known as Shadow
Earth; although it is commonly called by other names, such underworld,
netherworld, etc. In this under dimension, the picture perfect example of
what would happen to Earth if evil were to reign supreme paints the world
the Demons have known since the Earth was created. Fights constantly rage
across the surface of a charred, desolate, pathetic thing that somehow
passes for a planet. The sky is always a blood red. The sun in the sky
is pitch black, with a grey corona. Even when night falls, the black sky
still has a faint stain of red to it. In this twisted world, power and
greed reign supreme. The demon population is segregated up into various
clans, led by their own particular warlords. While all of these clans
constantly fight amongst each other, and serve their own ends, they
ultimately follow orders given by the strongest demon over all, who is
the Demon King. Before Garlic Jr left the Shadow Earth, he was the king
of demons. After he left, Dabura ascended to power there.

Every now and then, Demons manage to escape through dimensional rifts
into the living world. Either that, or they are summoned to the living
world by very powerful demons, such as Garlic Jr tended to do.

While it may seem like a depressing pile of nothing to anyone from the
living world, it is almost paradise to the Demon race. The living world
only surpases this realm as such, where in a demon can rain destruction,
fear, chaos, and murder upon the human race to their black hearts
content.

~

1 DEMONICECLIPSE "DEMONIC ECLIPSE"~
&R=======================================================================
&wThe ultimate attack used by demons, its creation was inspired by the
Shadow Earth's black sun. Concentrating an incredible amount of their
evil energy to a space between their palms, they create a small, black
sphere of energy with a red corona that resembles the black sun above.
The demon then lifts the sphere over their head, and hurls it towards
their enemy. The sphere grows in size until it makes contact with their
enemy, briefly consuming their enemy within the ball, inflicting
unspeakable amounts of pain and damage, afterwhich the sphere explodes,
with the enemy still inside it. Demonic Eclipse costs 3000 energy, and
takes 35 focus.

~

1 DEMONKING "DEMON KING"~
&R=======================================================================
&wThe Demon King is, 9 times out of 10, the undisputed strongest Demon.
Keeping this rank is, if you don't keep up with your training, one of
the hardest things to do. All other Demons that exist covet this rank
greatly, so be on your guard.

Currently the Demon King gains the following:

 &G* &RYou are able to use instant transmission without suppressing.&D

 &G* &RYou are able to learn and use the skill 'weapon soul seppuku'.&D

 &G* &RYou may use the &zminion&R command to summon 2 demon minions to
   do your bidding. Each demon is 1/3rd of your current pl. This
   command costs 50k energy to use. You may get rid of your minions
   by using the &zbanish&R command.&D

 &G* &RYou are able to use the sanctuary command.&D
~

1 DEMONRANK DEMONTITLE~
&R=======================================================================
&wWithin the Demon race, there is a very tenuous leadership framework.
Power is the only thing that matters in the Shadow Earth, so as such,
only the strongest Demons are recognized as leaders. Per to the way
the Demon society is composed, as in the Demon population being mostly
segregated up into warring clans, each with their own Warlord, and all
the Demon race pays respect to the most powerful Demon, who is the
Demon King.

Similar to the Kaio ranks, I created a Demon rank structure in order to
give Demons something to compete for. If a Demon has a Demon rank (it
will show up on the who list) they can be attacked at any time (provided
they are not in a safe room) by another Demon. If a normal Demon kills
a ranked Demon, then that Demon gains the rank the other Demon has, and
the other Demon loses that rank. If a Demon kills a higher Demon, then
their ranks switch. The rank order is set up as follows (from lowest
to highest):

&RGreater Demon
Demon Warlord
Demon King

&wEach Demon rank has its own special benefit or ability or command that
a Demon is able to access, if the Demon is that rank.

Different from the Kaio ranks, where there are only one of each, some
of the Demon ranks have multiple demons that hold that rank. There are
6 Greater Demon ranks up for grabs total, 3 Demon Warlord ranks, and
only 1 Demon King rank.

There are help files for these ranks, however, only the Demon that
holds that rank may read it.

Ranked Demons may attack other ranked Demons at any time, regardless of
whether or not the demon is of a higher or lower rank. This reflects the
chaotoic, warlike nature of the Demon society in which every Demon only
really looks out for themselves.&D
~

1 DEMONWARLORD "DEMON WARLORD"~
&R=======================================================================
&wDemon Warlord is the second highest rank of Demon within the Demon
race. Only the strongest of Demons ever hold this rank for long. If
you're a Demon Warlord, be sure to watch your back, because other
Demons will undoubtably want to try and kill you for this coveted rank.

Currently, Demon Warlords gain the following:

 &G* &RYou are able to use instant transmission without suppressing.&D

 &G* &RYou are able to learn and use the skill 'weapon soul seppuku'.&D

 &G* &RYou may use the &zminion&R command to summon 2 demon minions to
   do your bidding. Each demon is 1/3rd of your current pl. This
   command costs 50k energy to use. You may get rid of your minions
   by using the &zbanish&R command.&D
~

1 DEMONWEAPON "DEMON WEAPON"~
&R=======================================================================
&wBattle hardened over countless centuries of fighting, the Demons have
created some incredible techniques over the ages; and this is one of
them. Pumping very large amounts of energy into a given section of their
body, usually the arms or legs, or in some instances a dismembered limb,
a demon can create a weapon of metal and bone from their flesh.

Using this skill, a demon can create dual scimitars, a shortsword, a
longsword, a broadsword, a lance, and a maul.

Demon weapon takes your max energy, and 80 life, in order to use.

58 DENY DISCONNECT FREEZE~
Syntax: deny       <character>
Syntax: disconnect <character>
Syntax: freeze     <character>

DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.
DENY persists past reboots and crashes and can only be undone by either loading
up the character and doing a 'mset <character name> flags deny', or by editing
the player file offline.

DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.
~

65 DESTROY~
-----------------------------------------------------------

     SYNTAX:  destroy <target>

DESCRIPTION: The DESTROY command does exactly as it suggests:
             destroys player files. Caution, the command

0 DESTRUCTIVEWAVE DW~
&B========================================================================&C
This is a powerful attack learnable by all races.  The user powers up a
huge energy blast in front of one palm, while holding their arm steady
with their free hand. It costs 10 focus and 150 energy.
~

0 DESTRUCTODISK DD~
&B==========================================================================&C
Destructo Disk is an attack used many times by Krillin in the various
series.  Kienzen, Cutting Edge, is a large spinning disk of energy that
is thrown at your enemy, hopefully chopping off a limb or two.  It is
used many times to remove the tails of Saiyans, Halfbreeds, and Icers.
Humans originated this attack, then the Icer race also decided it was
quite useful.  The Icers have also perfected a slightly more advanced
version of this technique.  Destructo Disk costs 175 energy and 10
focus to perform.

-1 DIKU~
.         SMAUG was originally based on the Merc 2.1 code which was
              based on the orignal DIKUMud code created by:

                       The Original DIKUMud Team:

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science

1 DIVINEWRATH DIVINE WRATH~
&R=======================================================================
&wThe third and strongest kaio-only attack that a kaio learns during
their training. Divine Wrath, as far as attacks go, is on par with
the saiyan's Final Flash technique. Getting in to near-point-blank
range of their enemy, the kaio charges a sphere of energy that grows in
size till it engulfs their opponent for a short time, afterwhich it
shrinks back down and dissipates. Divine Wrath costs 3000 energy, and
takes 35 focus.

51 DND~
On or off syntax: DND

This command toggles your personal dnd flag.
This command effectively secludes immortals from those of lower level.
Each immortal has a personal dnd flag associated with their pfile. In
addition, each room can have a dnd flag associated with the room.

When your personal dnd flag is set, lower level imms can't 'at', 'goto',
'trans', sight you on 'where' or 'where (name). This does not affect LD
immortals, they can still be transferred, even with the DND flag on. To
see the flag's status, 'mstat self', it will be listed under 'pcflags'.
Syntax for room flag: redit flags DND

The DND room flag effectively blocks any 'at', and 'goto' commands
either to the room, or to a mob/object in the room. NOTE: It is only
in effect if:
a) there is an immortal in the room with their DND flag on.
b) the immortal attempting the commands is of lower level than the
   immortal with the activated DND flag in the room.
~

1 DODGE BLOCK DCD~
&R=======================================================================
&wDodge, Block, and DCD (Ie, Ki dodge, Ki Cancel, and Ki Deflect. Can't
name it the KKK skill for obvious reasons. :b) are 3 passive combat
skills. Dodge gives you a chance to dodge melee hits. Block gives you a
chance to block melee hits. DCD gives you a chance to dodge/cancel out/
deflect ki attacks. The mechanics of these skills will be explained below
(each of them have the same chance mechanics):

The base chance for it to work is 20%.

The number is first modified as follows:
If your speed is 25% over the opponent, the chance goes up 10%.
If your speed is 50% over the opponent, the chance goes up 20%.
If your speed is 100% over the opponent, the chance goes up 30%.
If your speed is 200% over the opponent, the chance goes up 50%.
If your opponents speed is 25% over yours, the chance goes down 5%.
If your opponents speed is 50% over yours, the chance goes down 10%.
If your opponents speed is 100% over yours, the chance goes down 15%.
If your opponents speed is 200% over yours, the chance goes down 20%.

The number is then increased/decreased by the powerlevel difference
between you and the opponent:

For every 50% you are higher than your opponent in powerlevel, the
chance increases 10%.
For every 50% the opponent is higher than you in pl, the chance goes
down 5%.

So you can have a maximum chance of 100%, and a minimum of 1%.

For example:
Say your powerlevel is 50million, and you have a speed of 40. Your
opponent is 50million, and has a speed of 20. Your chances of the
skill working would be around 40%. The opponents chances would be
around 5%.

Another example:
Say your powerlevel is 200million, and you have a speed of 10. Your
opponent is 50million, with a speed of 50. Your chances of the skill
working, despite the opponent having much, much higher natural speed,
would be around 80%. In this same setup, the opponent's chance for the
skill to work would be around 30% or so.

The downside to using these skills is that while they are active your
focus regeneration will be reduced by a given percent, based on what
combination of skills you have active.

Dodge reduces total focus regen by 5%
Block reduces total focus regen by 5%
DCD reduces total focus regen by 40%

So if you have all 3 skills active, your total focus gain per round
will be reduced by 50%.

&RTo turn these skills on and off, you must use the combat command.
These skills are automaticly set to on when you first practice them.&D

0 DODONPA DODONRAY DR~
&B========================================================================&C
The Dodon Ray was created and perfected by pracitioners of the
Crane style of martial arts.  This beam is fired from the tip of one
finger, usually while pointing it towards the opponent like a pretend
gun.  Much like a 'finger beam', Dodonpa is able to be fired quickly
and repeatedly.  It costs only 12 focus and 600 energy.

1 DRAGONBALL DRAGONBALLS DRAGON "DRAGON BALLS"~
&R=======================================================================
&wThe Dragonballs are one of the single most coveted relics that exist
in the dbz universe. It is fabled that if a person is able to collect
all 7, they can summon a dragon god that will grant them a wish.

Well, now they finally exist in this game. Once a week, the dragonballs
will be scattered randomly across the mud, afterwhich all the players
will be able to try and collect them all and summon the dragon. After
they have been collected, a person can summon the eternal dragon by
placing them on the ground, then typing &Rsummon&w. However, you cannot
summon the dragon without Karma there to supervise the event. Once the
dragon is successfully summoned, and a wish is granted, the dragon and
the dragonballs vanish, afterwhich everyone will have to wait a week
before the dragonballs will reappear again.

There are very strict rules governing the dragonballs. If you are
holding a dragonball, you can be killed by anyone. If you quit from the
game while holding one, it drops from your inventory. If you go linkdead
while holding one, it drops from your inventory. It cannot be sacced. It
cannot be given to others via the give command. Mobs cannot pick them
up. If delete yourself while holding them, they drop from your
inventory. If you are deleted by someone else while holding one, ditto.
If you are helled while holding one, ditto. Basicly, &Rany and all
attempts to remove dragonballs from the normal accessability of players
or to destroy them is ILLEGAL and will be met by swift, dire
punishments.&D If you do so, &Rall of your characters will be deleted,
and you will be banned.&D No ifs, ands, or buts. Taking a dragonball
into your house is also illegal, punishable by the same amount. So play
fair and honestly.

&ROnce you make a wish, you may not make another wish for one month.
&D
&RAll imms that wish to participate in dragonball quests with their
mort must first log off their imm, and remain off of it for the duration
of the quest. Not following these guidelines is grounds for serious
punishment. No excuses.&D

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET takes an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or
even from a corpse (TAKE is a synonym for get).

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

Use 'drop/get/put all' to reference all objects present.
Use 'drop/get/put all.<object>' to reference all objects of the same name.

Examples:
 - drop 1000 coins
 - get all.ball backpack
 - get 5 sword
 - put 15 potion backpack

0 DUALDESTRUCTODISK DDD~
&B======================================================================&C
After observing Humans using the Destructo Disk technique, Icers
copied it and used it for their own purposes.  Eventually they
perfected a new technique, whereby they could throw twice the number
of spinning energy disks.  This attack is powerful and deadly, with
a chance to instantly slice your enemy in two.  It costs 400 energy
and 18 focus to use.

0 EAT DRINK~
&B===========================================================================&C
Syntax:  drink <object>

         echo  imm <color> <message>
         echo  pc  <color> <message>
Syntax:  recho     <color> <message>

ECHO sends a message to all players in the game, without any prefix indicating
who sent it.  If 'echo imm <message>' is used, only level 51+ characters will
see the message. If 'echo pc <message>' is used, only player characters will
see the message. Echos should always adhere to the guidelines laid out in the
Realm of Order (vnum 1214).

ECHO done in color should avoid the use of red and dark red unless it is a
Urgent message containing important information related to the game.

RECHO sends a message to all players in your room, without any prefix
indicating who sent it.

~

51 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.

The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).

To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.

The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).

Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).

Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

0 ENERGY~
&B===========================================================================&C
Almost all martial artists believe in some sort of inner strength, or energy,
that they channel to perform their wonderous feats.  It is sometimes also
referred to as ki or chi.  In the normal world, this is sometimes showed
to increase a fighters strength and speed.  In the worlds of anime,
including the Dragon Ball universe, ki has gone far beyond that.  Now it is
considered common fact that the people in those universes can turn their
inner strength into energy attacks, inhuman speed, or the ability to
defy gravity.  On this MUD, ki is energy, which is what fuels most all
attacks and transformations into different forms.  It is also what powers
the Kaioken.

0 ENERGYBALL ENERGY_BALL BALL~
&B=======================================================================&C
Energy Ball is a basic ability that most any fighter learns once
they are strong enough to focus their energy.  It does very low damage,
but only costs 75 energy and 7 focus to use.
~

0 ENERGYGAIN~
&B==========================================================================&C
You gain energy whenever your powerlevel hits certain checkpoints. How
much you gain depends on your intelligence attribute, as well as a
certain amount of luck. There is a formula used to find when you will
receive your next energy increase.

(X * X * 5,000) where X is what energy gain you are expecting next.

For example, if you are expecting your third energy gain, you would gain
it at: ( 3 * 3 * 5,000 ) = 45,000 PL. The first few gains are provided
for your convenience:

     (1)      5k    (6)   180k   (11)   605k   (16)  1,280k

&wThe Enhance upgrade is designed for type H and type FM Androids.
Utilizing specific aspects of its systems, in conjuction with the
additional hardware, this upgrade allows a type H android to increase its
speed at will, and allows a type FM android to increase its strength at
will. The boost from the skill is relatively small at first, but
increases at specific intervals of techlevel.

TL Req           Stat increase  Energy cost

0 EVASIVE~
&B==========================================================================&C
All you have to do is type 'style evasive' to use this mode of combat.
This style of fighting focuses on the art of dodging and parrying blows.
Less damage will be taken by a fighter using this style, but the damage
a fighter does in battle is also reduced due to the concentration needed
for evading an enemy.

1 EVILBOOST EVILSURGE EVILOVERLOAD "EVIL BOOST" "EVIL SURGE" "EVIL OVERLOAD"~
&R=======================================================================
&wThese three techniques are the primary powerlevel boosting techniques
of the Demon race. Realisticly, they are all pretty much the same skill,
but for the fun of it I decided to split them up.

Evil Boost is a x3-6 variable mod. Evil Surge is a x8-14 variable mod.
Evil Overload is a x18-24 variable mod. Each skill requires 300 energy
multiplied by the mod number. These forms increase your stats in the
following ways: Strength is increased directly by the number of the mod,
and so is constitution. Speed and intelligence are increased by half of
the mod number.

These mods are increased when the Makeo Star comes near to the Orbit of
the Earth; however, the stat increases are not.

51 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
Currently there can only be one exit in a certain direction.
The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~
&B============================================================================&C
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).

See Also:  &WCOMPASS NORTH
~

51 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by spell or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.
~

1 EXTREME~
&B==========================================================================
&CExtreme is a technique usable only by pure humans. It's full and proper
name is 'Extreme Heart.' Essentially, it is a combination of both the heart
skill and the hyper skill rolled into one. No one knows who created this
skill, though rumors exist that some nameks may have experimented with
drawing forth hidden powers and combining skills. Either way, the skill is
very effective at drawing forth the hidden power within an otherwise weak
race.

~

0 EYEBEAM EB~
&B=======================================================================&C
Nameks and Icers both have the ability to channel their ki through
their eyes, shooting out deadly beams of force.  This attack doesn't
do much damage, but can be very surprising in a close fight.  It
cost 250 energy and 13 focus to use.
~

0 FB FINGERBEAM~
&B==========================================================================&C
Icers enjoy using many underhanded attacks, hoping to catch their
enemies by surprise and deal them a painful blow.  Not only can they shoot
beams of force from their eyes like Nameks, they have also created
an attack that fires energy from their fingertips.  This attack does
a fair amount of damage, and costs 350 energy to use.  There is a
small confusion on how to fire this attack, you must put the name
between apostrophes, as in 'finger beam'.

Finger beam costs 15 focus and 325 energy to perform.

~

0 FINALFLASH FINAL FLASH FF~
&B=========================================================================&C

1 FOCUS~
&B=============================================================================&C
Focus is used to determine how quickly you may use skills and abilities while
in battle.  Your focus points will increase during battle and decrease when
you are not in battle.  Any attack that is done in battle will take a set
amount of focus away from you based on which attack you use.

The maximum focus points you can have at one time is determined by your
intelligence.

56 FOLDAREA~
Syntax:  foldarea <area filename>

This command saves an area file, usually after modification.

&rThis command must be used with extreme care.  If you aren't
exactly and intimately familiar with the changes being made
or what the command does -- don't use it.&w

*NOTE*
Area files have backups that record the file as it was prior to foldarea.
If you folda something and realize there's a mistake, and you've only
folded it once -- don't do anything else.  Post a note or find Blodkai.

Do not fold changes into non-quest areas that are quest related.  If you
must do this, write a note or ensure it's changed back.

Any time an area is folded, document it with the fixed command.

limitations.  Everything is harder under intense gravity, even the
most regular tasks can almost become impossable.

You may train in the grav rooms as long as you have room to imporove
your self.  Therefor, you must have at least 1 training point before
you begin.  For every minute you train a stat you gain between 1 and
3 percent to that stat until it becomes 100% and the stat you've been
training goes up by a full point.  Even if you don't have any training
points, sometimes you can still push your self and get very close to
increasing your stats, BUT you still will not gain a full point unless
you have an extra training point.

Setting how many minutes you wish to train for makes you train for
that many MUD minutes.  One in game minute is about one second real
time.  You can train for as long as you wish, but you will have to
take a break eventualy.

0 GROWTH GIANTSIZE 'GIANT SIZE'~
&B===============================================================================&C
Nameks are masters of their own body.  They know how to use their inner
energy to heal themselves and others, as well as how to manipulate their
form.  Powerful Namekians can not only stretch parts of their bodies, but
also grow to incredible sizes.

This gives a great boost to their physical power, but also reduces their
quickness.  Sometimes the added strength is well worth the slowed movements.

&B==========================================================================&C
Halfbreeds are not a simple mix of just any two races. They are, more
specifically, half Human and half Saiyan. Halfbreeds, for the most part,
live on Earth. Like Saiyans they are born with a monkey tail. Also, like
their Saiyan parents, they have the ability to become a Super Saiyan.
They also transform into giant beasts known as Oozaru, though this
is only possible if their tails are still attached during a full
moon. Rumor has it that halfbreeds are incapable of attaining as high
a level of Super Saiyan. Though this is hard to prove, since so few
attain such unheard-of power.

  affected by the offensive conduct.
- The harasser's conduct must be unwelcome.

&WExamples of Harassment&C:

0 HC HARDCORE UNKNOWN~
&B==========================================================================&C
Hard Core Mode
--------------
Benefits of HC mode:
* You show up on the who list as an 'Unknown'.  That way nobody
  can tell what your power level is by your rank.
* You will NOT show up on any of the hiscore tables.  That way
  nobody can attempt to guess how strong you might be.
* HC players will be the ONLY players allowed to collect bounties
  that have been placed on other players. (when the bounty code is
  turned back on)
* No alignment restrictions at all.  So you can spar
  anyone, or join any clan.  The only people who know what your
  true alignment is are the ones you tell.
* You cannot be seen entering/exiting a room, even by other HC's.
  Essentually, as a leet would put it, "OMIGAWD UR TEH NYNJA! HAX!"

The 'Not so Good Things' (TM) about HC mode:
* You can be killed by normal or HC players at any time.  (it's
  like having a permanent red pk flag on)  You are protected
  until you have 100k pl however.

If played right, the hard core character is by far the scariest
character in the game.  The only thing you can ever know for sure
about a hard core player is their name, because, combined with
suppress, they can lie about everything about them selves.  If a
hard core character can role play well (or is just a good liar),
everyone else better watch out...
~

0 HEADENFORCER~
&B============================================================================
&W
The Head Enforcer. Highest amongst the ranking of Enforcement in the game.
Those lucky to attain such a rank are 'Judge, Jury, and Executioner.' as
they see fit. They have absolute authority over lower Enforcement staff and
an even higher requirement of responsibility.

Head Enforcers are meant to be constantly on. Watching and monitoring the game
as a whole. Players and Administrators alike, both are under the careful watch
of this person(s). Responsibilites include, but are not limited to, the following:

   * Maintenance and overall basic work to be done in game.
   * Assisting in lower level administration, be it building or otherwise.
   * Working with higher up administrators to further the game.
   * Isolating and/or fixing bugs in game.
   * All responsibilites included with Enforcer and Builder(*)

*Responsibilities are assigned by Head Builder/Coder as they see fit.
   Head Enforcers don't require building experience, but it is a plus.

&B============================================================================
~

0 HEART~
&B==========================================================================&C
Humans never seem to know quite when to give up, fighting until the bitter
end.  When a Saiyan or Icer may not be able to fight any longer, a Human
will simply use his pain for motivation.  This ability, called heart, lets
Humans compete with the strange alien races through sheer guts and
determination.  Whenever their health drops to a certain amount, this will
slowly start to boost their powerlevel.  If a Human raises their constitution
above 30 this ability will begin to work.  The higher their constitution is
raised, the earlier heart will activate and the more it will boost their
powerlevel.  As with all other things, luck seems to have some effect as well..
~

0 HEAVENSPLITTERCANNON HSC~
&B=========================================================================&C
This feared attack definately lives up to its namesake, splitting the
heavens - and your opponent - quite well.  Also known as the Chou
Bakuretsumaha (Super Explosion Demon Blast), this is the most
powerful single technique posessed by the Namek race.  A huge
sphere of ki is created between both hands, and then fired at the
target, where it explodes quite grandly.  This technique uses 1000
energy and requires 30 focus.
~

51 HEDIT~
Syntax: hedit [help topic]

This command allows you to edit a help topic.  If the specified help topic
does not exist, it will be created for you. The default help page (summary)
will be selected if you do not specify a page.

NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name>
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player's prompt. &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors. However there are a couple of quirks to take
note of:
&Y
    1) At the very least, the first character of a help file cannot be
       either the symbol '&&' or the symbol '^^'.
    2) Color changes have to be separated by at least one character. ie,
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' will cause problems.
    3) Color codes are imbedded within text and _do_ count in note buffers
       for line length. ie, watch out for <Long Line Trimmed>.
&w
Colors should be used to &Yenhance &wthe help file, or specific parts of the
help file. Tact and restraint should be used if considering the use of colors.

The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>".

Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours".  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.

You may not hell someone for more than thirty days with the hell command.

To release a player from hell, simply "unhell <character>".

0 HELLSFLASH HF~
&R=======================================================================
&wOnce again, this technique draws upon the modular design of the type
FM androids. After knocking an opponent to the ground, an android can
detach their forearms just below the elbow, revealing a large array of
energy crystals/nodes. Using this particular system, the android can
quickly charge and fire an energy blast of massive proportions from its
arms. Once the android is done firing, it reattaches its arms again.
Hells Flash costs 800 energy, and 25 focus to use.

0 HELLZONEGRENADE HG~
&B=========================================================================&C
Known throughout the universe for their unique combination of
physical and mental prowess, Nameks have devised a technique that
unilizes their advanced intellect to surprise their enemies.  After
performing what seems to be a rather badly aimed scatter shot,
Nameks will freeze the fired energy balls in mid-air, surrounding their
opponent.  Next their ki balls are guided towards the trapped target,
up to fifty of them easily hitting their mark.

Each shot is 50 energy and 1 focus. Ie, a HZG 25 would be 25 focus. 50
would be 50 focus. Etc etc. The minimum focus is 12, however. So even a
HZG 1 would be 12 focus.

0 HISCORE~
&B=============================================================================&C
&YSyntax: hiscore [keyword]&w

&CThis command is used to see a hiscore table. Without parameters, it
lists all the tables. If you supply a parameter, it will show you
the chosen table.  If you pick a person's name, it will show you all hiscores
held by that character.
~

65 HISCOSET~
&YSyntax: hiscoset <command> [keyword] [field] [value]\n\r&w

Hiscoset is the command to set and create hiscore tables.

Command can be:
    list                     Lists all hiscore tables.
    show <kwd>               Shows the data for that table.
    create <kwd>             Create new table with that keyword.
    destroy <kwd>            Destroy table with that keyword.
    set <kwd> <field> <val>  Sets data for that table.

Field can be:
    keyword <str>            Set new keyword for the table.
    vnum <num>               Set an object vnum for this table.
    desc <str>               Set the description.
    maxlength <num>          Set Max entries in the table.
    entry <name> <score>     Change the score for a player.

If the 'vnum' field is -1, the table will be accessible via the
'hiscore' command; if it's different from -1, it will be visible
only by looking at the object with that vnum.
If you decrease maxlength, entries at the end will be chopped. If
you increase it, it will slowly fill up.

51 HITALL~
Syntax: hitall

Hitall is a fighter skill that will start a fight by hitting all the

mobs, for deadlies it means all the deadly players in the room.

Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.

0 HLIST~
&B=============================================================================&C
Syntax:  hlist <keyword/letter>

This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them.

Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.

Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.

51 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.

1 HOUSECOMMANDS~
&B===========================================================================&C
The accessories command is used to add furniture and house mobs(if
defined) to existing houses without any immortal interaction.  It's a great
way to have them be able to buy regenerative furniture or guards or maybe
even fountains and the like.  Immortals need to add accessories to this
command for them to buy though.  Apartments are not able to have
accessories.

The homebuy command is the main one used for interaction with the automated
housing system.  This command allows for a mortal to bid on or find more
information on a house on auction and for immortals to control every
feature of a current residence on auction.  New residences can be added to
the auction using this command by immortals, for basically beginning the
circulation of a house through the system.  Sellhouse is the mortal aspect
of adding residences to the auction and will be mentioned in its own
accompanying description.

The house command is used by mortals for manipulation of their house.  They
are able to edit names and descriptions for their housing rooms as well as
add additional rooms by themselves.  Apartments are not able to have extra
rooms added.  The house command also has features for immortals to have
manual control over houses.

The residence command is a simple command to list the relevant information
about current residences.  Residences on it are in alphabetical order.

The sellhouse command is the second command used for interaction with the
automated housing system.  It places a mortal's residence on the housing
auction for the default bid or for the bid the mortal specifies, which has
to be above the default bid.  This command is mostly used for
recirculating houses through the housing auction structure.&D

51 HSET~
Syntax: hset  <command> [value] [help topic]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page

Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in spellcasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:

       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

Setting a help entry level to -1 prevents the header from showing up
when you view the help with the help command.

&B========================================================================&C
Humans are classifed as almost anything originating on the planet Earth.
Usually what would be a strange race to us - like Tien's, Chaozu's, or
the many animal people - is considered to be a Human in the different
series.  Humans are thought to be the most varied because of this, coming
from many different backgrounds and walks of life.  They may not be the
most powerful race at the beginning, but they have many quirks that give
them advantages.

1 HYPER~
&B==========================================================================&C
Hyper is a powerful technique the Great Master Roshi created.  Master Roshi
was never strong enough to fully use the power of this ability though,
and kept it secret until he felt the other humans were ready.

Once learned, this ability allows a person to increase his or her power by
an extreme amount.  The user focuses their energy and pumps it throughout
their body.  This causes their muscles to bulge and reach incredible sizes,
their form burning with inner flame, increasing a human's power level far
beyond what anyone thought possible.

The only down side to Hyper is that the user must force a large amount of
energy into their body and then contain it there.  However, this initial
expenditure of energy is well rewarded by a massive increase in power.

A 'bug' is an error in the MUD program that causes undesired or unplanned
results.  Some bugs are obvious and others are not.

An example of an obvious bug is, you type 'train grav 10' and you gain 10
PL, but when you type 'train grav 11' you gain 11 million PL.  Another
example of an obvious bug is, you type 'kill fighter' and the MUD
crashes.

If you are unsure if something is a bug or not, then please ask an
administrator.

The 'bug', 'idea', and 'typo' commands will take a message and record it
as feedback to the MUD admins.

Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring.

Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for
them to be logged on at the time.

Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you.

Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.

1 ILLEGAL_ACTIVITY~
Recently, some players have thought it amusing to evade bans, attack our
server, and harass via other methods. This is to remind all of you that
there are such regulations as Internet Abuse Laws. While we regret having
to resort to this, in defense of this game and in defense of those that
play this game to simply have fun, we can and will press charges against
anyone who violates Saga in such a manner.

And for those that don't know, these are US Federal laws, and have been
applied internationally. Don't think we won't do this simply because it's a
hassle, because I assure you that we will.

51 IMMAUTH AUTH AUTHORIZE~
AUTHORIZE
Syntax: authorize <name>
Syntax: authorize <name> no
Syntax: authorize <name> name
Syntax: authorize fixlist

This code runs the authorization system. It should be set to a reasonably
low level, so that your lower immortals can handle authorizing names.
A player who is authorized by the code offline will be permitted to
gain levels up to level 5 before being required to obtain authorization.

To approve a name, simply type 'authorize <name>' and the name will be
approved.

To deny a name, and remove the associated player file type:
'authorize <name> no'. This option should only be used for a name that
is considered extremely offensive, this option will delete the pfile.

To have the player change names, type: 'authorize <name> name'.

If the authorize list is somehow broken, IE: a name can't be approved
or denied, type: 'authorize fixlist'.

See also: NAME~

55 IMMHOST~
Syntax:  immhost add    <name> <host>
Syntax:  immhost delete <name> <host>
Syntax:  immhost save
Syntax:  immhost
This command is for setting the hosts allowed for immortals that are added
with this command.  Wildcards are allowed (*), so *edu, would allow any domain
from edu connect and 127*, would allow any local domain to connect.
IMMHOST without arguments will show a list of names and what domains they are
allowed to connect from.
To delete a command you need to provide the name and the host, this allows
for multiple hosts for a certain name.
This file won't be saved until the immhost save command is issued.
~

61 IMMORTALIZE~
syntax: immortalize <char> <position>

Positions:
1 - Level 51 Admin (Trustee)
2 - Level 52 Admin (General Admin) (not a real position)
3 - Level 55 Admin (Builder)
4 - Level 56 Admin (Admin Builder)
5 - Level 58 Admin (Advanced Builder)
6 - Level 61 Admin (Head Builder)
7 - Level 54 Admin (Builder)

59 INSTALLAREA~
Syntax: installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>

Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.
The filename can be fixed with aset, (don't forget to foldarea the new name.)

Currently the builder should quit and have his/her vnums cleared manually.
(This should be fixed soon).
~

0 INSTANTTRANSMISSION "INSTANT TRANSMISSION"~
&B==================================================================&C
Syntax: 'instant transmission' <name>

Instant transmission is an ancient technique that only the oldest
of civilizations know of it's existence.  The only people known to
teach this ability are the Yardrats and the Kais.  There may be
others who know how to instruct people, but it is unknown.

Because of the great power that instant transmission gives a
character, there are limitations to it's power.

* You can't transport to someone who is more than 10 times
  stronger than you.
* You can't transport to someone who can be pked.  That includes
  characters with red and yellow pk flags, hardcore players, and
  players that you are trying to collect a bounty on.

You can transport to mobs as well as players.

Update:

Instant transmission only costs Kaio's 1k energy to use, rather than
the 5k it costs normal races. Also, a Kaio may IT to anyone, regardless
of pl, as long as the person is not pkable.
~

0 INT INTELLIGENCE~
&B=============================================================================&C
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity and focus.  It has the following effects:

* Determins the max focus points you can gain
* Determins the rate that you gain focus points in battle
* Determins how quickly you 'learn' when using skills and abilities

See Also:  &WSTR SPD CON LCK
~

56 IPCOMPARE~
Syntax: ipcompare <name>
        ipcompare <site>
        ipcompare <name or site> <room|area|world> <#>

This takes * as a wild card.
Ipcompare will compare online users to search for multiplayers. A positive
match using ipcompare does not always mean it is a multiplayer..but shows
that there are more than one user from a site on simultaneously.
Ipcompare <field> <#> will limit the output to x number of lines based on #.
* may be used as a wild card, for example ipcompare 207.18.3.* will return
matches from any that begin with the ip prior to the asterisk.
Ipcompare <field> <room|area|world> will limit the search based on that
criteria.  The room|area|world limitation will be judged on the room that
the immortal issued the command in.  So if you are in a different area
than the victim, it will show only players matching the site in the area
you are in.
~

1 ISLVIN_PLAN~
&B==================================================================================
&zRecently completed projects:
    enabled base -> SSJ* form (costs more energy than normal)
    icer transformations now work like the old SSJ transformations did (sorry icers)
      -I did lower energy costs though, so that'll help make up for it
    added combat +/- heart for humans
     -Combat +heart turns heart on. It's disabled by default due to a bug that some
      particular people were exploiting to stack with Extreme.
    added the Extreme skill for humans--see 'help extreme' for details
    added a diceroll feature for roleplay channel
     -Can only roll one di as of now. May add a multi-di feature if Viola requests it.

&cCurrent projects:
    Trying to fix some stuff for Viola.

&WPlanned projects (to be hopefully completed within two weeks):
    fix a small glitch with splitform and sparring (this may take a while)
    keep trying to track down gboard bug (might take a while, too)

&OProjects on hold:
    two combat-round delay to spirit bomb

&RFor those that have been making suggestions to me:
I'm only one person, and I can only do so much at one time. If you want to make a
suggestion, that's fine. If I think it'll be useful, or if I like it, I'll write
it down somewhere. But don't pester me about it, because that makes me not want
to do it at all.&D

-1 KAIO~
&R=======================================================================
&wThe Kaio's origins aren't really known. Its pretty much guessed that
at some point shortly after the creation of the universe, that the Kaio's
were created to serve the function of overseeing and protecting the
various beings and species all around the universe. Even with this
mandate, there are a few rare cases of Kaio's becoming evil, but other
than that, as a whole, the Kaio race is generally that of a divine good.
While not a particularly strong, warrior race, the Kaio's do make up for
an inherent sense of weakness when compared to other races, by having
some rather incredible techniques and abilities. The Kaio race's home
planet is simply known as the Sacred Planet of the Kai's, which actually
exists in the afterlife ("otherworld"), as opposed to the mortal realm.

The Kaio race was almost wiped out, when it was attacked by Bibidi and
Bibidi's ultimate creation, Majin Buu. However, a few of the kaio's
managed to survive the slaughter, and their numbers slowly went up
again over time. The Kaio's have begun playing an ever-increasing role
in the events of present times.

~

1 KAIOCREATE~
&R=======================================================================
&wKaio create is one of the Kaio's special abilities. Utilizing their
supernatural powers, a Kaio can use their own energy to craft an item
from nothingness. This ability does not serve much purpose to help
themselves. Rather, it mainly serves the function of helping others.
Using this technique, a Kaio can create a shirt item, a vest, a belt,
some pants, some sleeves, and a pair of boots. Kaio create costs
99,999 energy to use.

See also: &WKAIO, SHOCKWAVE, PSIONICBLAST, DIVINEWRATH&D
~

0 KAIOKEN~
&C&B==============================================================================&C
The Kaioken Attack was created by King Kai, but he was unable to use
it because of his frail body.  This technique is very risky, as it drains
the user's ki/energy extremely quickly.  However, it increases your
powerlevel so greatly that sometimes the strength you gain is quite
worth the risk.

The higher your base powerlevel, the higher of a multiplier you may
use in Kaioken.  Also, the higher the multiplier, the more energy you
will use up per hit.  This counts for hits you deliver, and hits
the enemy delivers to you.  Be very careful while using it.  For,
if you run out of energy, you will also lose control of the Kaioken.
Even while only sparring, your body will be consumed in a quite
glorious explosion.

1 KAIORANK KAIOTITLE~
&R=======================================================================
&wWithin the Kaio race, there is a heirarchy of leaders, known as the
Kaioshins, set up to govern the 4 quadrants of the universe.
The South Kaioshin governs the South quadrant, the East Kaioshin governs
the East quadrant, the West Kaioshin governs the West quadrant, and the
North Kaioshin governs the North quadrant. The Grand Kaioshin oversees
the actions of the 4 Kaioshins. And the Supreme Kaioshin oversees the
actions of them all.

To be sporting, I decided that the Kaioshins can compete for these
titles. If a Kaio has a Kaioshin title (it will show up on the who
list) they can be attacked at any time (provided they are not in a safe
room) by another Kaio. If a normal Kaio kills a Kaioshin, then that Kaio
gains the rank the Kaioshin has, and the Kaioshin loses that rank. If
a Kaioshin kills a higher Kaioshin, then their ranks switch. The rank
order is set up as follows (from lowest to highest):

&gSouth Kai
&GEast Kai
&BWest Kai
&YNorth Kai
&WGrand kai
&RSupreme Kai

&wEach kaioshin rank has its own special benefit or ability or command that
a kaio is able to access, if the kaio is that rank.

There are help files for these ranks, however, only the Kaioshin that
holds that rank may read it.

Kaioshins may attack kaioshins of a higher rank, but higher ranked kaioshins
may not attack lower ranked kaioshins.
~

11 KAIRESTORE~
&B==========================================================================&C
The two commands related to the East Kai commands are kairestore and
setrestoremessage.  Kairestore is used, obviously, to do a restore all.  This
command does not affect you, only everyone around you.  The setrestoremessage
command sets a custom restore message, which is what everyone will see when you
use the kairestore command.  Your restore message must NOT be vulgar or
inappropriate in any way, and it must contain your name.  Anyone found with such
will first receive a warning, and then a more serious punishment, such as a ban
or loss of the command(s).  The setrestoremessage command can accept the $n
token, $n being where your name would be substituted.
~

0 KAMEHAMEHA~
&B=======================================================================&C
This technique, developed by the legendary Master Roshi, is an attack
that Humans, Saiyans, and Halfbreeds can aquire.  Roughly translated,
it means 'turtle style blast'.  It is also named after a Hawaiian
king, since most everything in the Dragon Ball universe is some sort of
pun.  The Kamehameha fires a blue beam at the target, causing moderate
damage.  This attack costs 375 energy and 15 focus.&D
~

53 KEYWORD 'BIO DESC DESCRIPTION' BIO~
~

58 KHISTORY~
Syntax: khistory <player>

This command will display a list of mobs recently killed by the
character in question.
This is an imm only command.
~

0 KIABSORB 'KI ABSORB'~
&B===============================================================================&C
Dr. Gero deisgned his creations to be able to combat the massive Ki atatcks that
the fighters on Earth had exhibited.  The way he did this was to give them the
ability to actually absorb some, or all, of what was sent their way.  On top of
that, being the mad genius he was, he also made it so some of the Ki that was
absorbed would be turned into energy that the Android could use.

This ability is another form of defense, for Androids, which tries to kick in
automatically ever time certain Ki attacks are used against an Android.  Certain
Ki attacks, due to their nature, can not be absorbed.

See Also:  &WCOMBAT&D
~

0 KIBURST 'KI BURST'~
&B===============================================================================&C
Bio-Androids have delevoped this move for when you simply need to put some
distance between you and your opponent.  And, of course, punish them for
daring to fight the eventual addition of their soul to your collection.  By
pushing a large amount of gathered ki energy outwards in a spherical burst
of power, Bio-Androids can send their victims flying, with devastating
results.  This is one of the few moves all Bio-Androids automatically learn,
and is their most powerful attack.  It uses 1000 energy and requires 35
focus.

Be sure to type 'ki burst' to use this move, otherwise the game will default
to kill instead of ki burst.
~

0 KIHEAL 'KI HEAL'~
&B===============================================================================&C
Nameks are well known for their regenerate abilities.  Powerful members of this
race of knowledgable warriors have learned how to impart this healing to other
races, through transference of ki energy into an injured body.  Placing their
hands over the injuries, Nameks can heal wounds by giving up some of their own
energy.  This ability costs 700 energy per point of life healed.

The syntax is: 'ki heal' <target> # or 'ki heal' <target> full.  If you leave
off the amount of life you wish to heal, it will default to full.

0 KILL~
&B==========================================================================&C
Syntax:  kill <character> [now]

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  If you plan on
killing another player you need to type 'kill <name> now'.  You have to
type 'now' to prevent accidental killings.

52 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:

&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.

&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values. The lower the
value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is. Valid
numeric values are:

&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.

&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.

It is suggested that only those items that will occupy the highest value
slots, or a slot of 0, have any special affects added to them. Underclothing
should only have a.c. settings.

0 LCK LUCK~
&B==============================================================================&C
Luck represents the tendency of a character to succeed or prosper through
chance or good fortune.  As in life, the exact extent of this factor remains
and will always remain shrouded in uncertainty...

Also as in life, however, it can be said with surety that its influence on a
character is pervasive.  Though it affects some aspects of life here in a
very direct manner, it can affect nearly every aspect to at least a degree.

Luck can change day to day, so you will never know how lucky you are until
you go out and see what fortune, or misfortune, the new day brings you.

52 LITTERBUG~
Syntax: litterbug <player>

Places/removes the litterbug flag, allowing/prohibiting a player from
dropping any objects.
~

65 LOADUP~
Syntax:  loadup <player>

LOADUP allows one to load up a player's character (playing or not), to do
whatever needs be done to the character.  (Modifying a flag, changing a
password... etc).  Use FORCE to make the character do your bidding.

If we make any changes to the char, we comment the char and place a note in
their inventory explaining who loaded them up and what changes were made.
The character is transed to room 99 and forced to quit there (unless they
are going to be left in hell).  If we don't make any changes to the char, we
trans them back from where they came and force quit them there.  Loadup is
used primarily when a player quits to avoid dealing with immortals or if
they quit before you finish writing a comment.  But it is also used to
investigate chars for duping and other allegations made against them.

So... there is actually a wide range of reasons to use loadup and you are
encouraged to use your discretion in this area.

If you load up a character to slay or purge them, you must post in 1205.

See FORCE
~

55 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.
The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the players
name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
     snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded
    ** For example, you hear someone is having a mud affair, it is not
    ** important to the reason you are snooping.  Do not judge or pass
    ** on information learned in this manner.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

1 MAKEOSTAR~
&R=======================================================================
&wA dark star that passes by the Earth every 12 thousand years. It is
theorized that the energies this star radiates when its near Earth are
responsible for creating rifts in the dimensions that Demons are able to
escape through to the living realm.

But since it would be incredibly ridiculous to have the Makeo Star only
show up every 12 thousand in-game years, it shows up the 15th of each
in-game month, at night time, similar to how the moon shows up for the
same amount of time each month on the 30th.

While the Makeo Star is in orbit near the Earth, all Demons are fed a
substantial boost in power by the star. This gives them a x10 mod,
similar to Oozaru. However, unlike Oozaru, this mod cannot be avoided,
and it cannot be removed, until the Star leaves the Earth's orbit.

The mod from the Makeo Star stacks with all demon transformations.

1 MCCP MCP COMPRESS COMPRESSION~
Syntax: compress [on/off]

This command enables or disables MCCP (Mud Client Compression Protocol).
If it is typed with out an argument then it displays wether or not you
are currently using MCCP.

MCCP helps by compressing the data stream from the MUD to your computer.
This can decrease lag as well as lower our bandwidth usage.  Most MUD
clients support MCCP (or some call it MCP for Mud Compression Protocol)
and we ask that you please use MCCP at all times.  It's not required but
we would be very happy if you did use it.

If you are having problems turning on MCCP then you may want to double
check to make sure your client supports MCCP and that MCCP support is
active.

-1 MENTALSTATE MENTALSTATES 'MENTAL STATE' 'MENTAL STATES'~
.
&gYour mental state is your current frame of mind, and how clearly and
realistically you view your surroundings.  Mental states can be affected
by prolonged combat, hunger, thirst, or poison.  If you are affected by
one of the above for a period of time, your mental state will begin to
deteriorate, and you will not view your surroundings as they truly are.
You may begin to hallucinate, or become too lethargic to function, and
your general abilities will be affected.  In extreme cases you may
collapse from exhaustion or enter a delirious coma.

To restore your mental state, you may need to rest (resting and sleeping
will speed your recovery), eat, cure whatever poison afflicts you, etc.
Note that if you are malnourished your state will &wnot&g improve, even with
sleep, until you have fed and/or quenched your thirst.

Your mental state is by the text line in 'score' which describes your state
of mind (You feel great, etc.)  The 'group' display contains a less accurate
reading of your and your group-mates' mentalstates as well.

Note:  Changing your deity now affects your mental state.

1 MISC_RULES~
&B==========================================================================&C
Do not do anything to 'bend the rules' so that you or another player
benefits from it.

Do not ask for any favors from imms.  This includes pl, eq, zeni, and
anything else you can think of that'd constitute favortism.  If you believe
an imm is showing favortism, report it to a level 58+ imm.

If you are aware of a player breaking the rules and you do not turn them
in, and we find out about it, you can expect to be held as an accomplice.
This means that you will be receiving the same punishment as the player
that is breaking the rules.

Trying to avoid the auction tax is a nono, and you'll get admin taxed 
instead.

If you are currently serving a sentence in hell, you are by no means able
to transfer equipment to another alt by means of auction or otherwise.
Doing so will result in your equipment being destroyed and zeni put to 
zero.

Attacking people in a room containing a supermob or admin is illegal,
punishable by short term hellings. Usually 1 to 2 hours or so.&D
~

53 MISSILES~
Creating a projectile is basically the same as making any other
weapon. The exception to this are its Values (see ITEMVALUES)
and the need to have missiles which match missileweapons.

&GFollow this basic proceedure to make a set of projectiles&W:
  1) Create a firing mechanism, for instance, a long bow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'missileweapon'.
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take missile'
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the Value3 (V3) from the table in HELP WEAPONTYPES.

&G Now the wielded weapon is done, but you need something to fire...&W
  1) Create a shootable object, for instance, an arrow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'projectile'
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take'.
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the V3 to match the V3 on the firing mechanism you created.

Don't forget to finish the items with weight, cost, long, short etc.
You now have two objects in inventory which are ready to fire.
Lastly, you may create a quiver for certain objects. To do this,
set the itemtype to 'quiver', and use v0 to set its capacity.
Be sure not to set the capacity too high, as quivers should be small.

0 MOD MINIONSOFDARKNESS~
&B==================================================================&w
Long, long ago, Gods and Demons roamed the mortal realms, constantly
they battled, the Gods and their allies against the Demon hoardes.
The battles continues for Eons, neither side able to finish the other,
the mortal realms were in shambles, the long war taking its toll,
untill a traitorous act turned the tide...

One of the Lesser Demon Kings was swayed to the side of the Gods,
betraying his bretheren and revealing all thier secrets and weaknesses.
With his help the Demon hordes and the other Demon Kings were destroyed,
all but the Dark Lord himself. Beaten and subdued but unable to be killed,
the Gods imprisioned him in the Nether Dimension from which, in his weakened
state he could not escape. For his treachery the Lesser Demon King was rewarded
with the position of gate keeper to the afterlife, a position which he still
fills today, long after the Gods whom he served have left, never to be seen again.

For many Eons the Dark Lord remained a helpless prisoner in the Nether Dimensions,
until the Chaos, Pain, and suffering on the mortal realms reach such a point
that he could begin to exert his influence once more. He first succeded
when he made contact with a young psychic named Noel Xedorac. Xedorac
wanted power, the Dark Lord wanted to increase his influence in the mortal
realm so that he might once again be free, and so Xedorac became the Avatar
of the Dark Lord, bringing Chaos, Pain and Suffering to the mortal realm
and recruiting others to his cause...

Requirements: 1 billion or higher powerlevel, an evil roleplay alignment
an authed bio and a willingness to roleplay.

"We look forward not to your death,
                  but to the long road of suffering that will take you there."

~

0 MULING~
&B==========================================================================&C
Muling is the transferring of items between 2 or more of a players
characters.  This is sometimes done by dropping items on the ground for
the other character or by having another player hold on to the items
while you log on one of your alternate characters.

Many things can go wrong during this process that could cause you to lose
your items.  Because of this, if you do end up losing items you will not
receive any reimbursements for the lost items.

The administrative staff does not condone muling.  MULE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

0 MULTIDISK 'MULTI DISK'~
&B===================================================================&C
By mixing the concepts of Destructo Disk and Scatter Shot, Krillin
unleashed a disk that was able to split itself into several other
spinning ki disks.  His technique has been picked up and further
perfected by those of the Human race, allowing them to unleash
this deadly attack when their opponent least expects it.

Multi Disk costs 100 ki per disk and 12 focus for each 10 disks.
~

1 MULTIEYEBEAM~
&R=======================================================================
&wThe premise of this technique is taking the skill eye beam to the next
level. With Multi Eye Beam, a type E android can fire between 1 and 25
pairs of eye beams. This attack was used by android 20, Ie Dr Gero, to
destroy a city 10 miles southwest of South City, when Goku refused to
fight him due to there being innocent people still within the city. To
use this skill, type 'multi eye beam' #, where # is a number between 1
and 25. Multi eye beam costs 100 energy per pair of eye beams, and has
a focus requirement similar to the 'scattered finger beam' technique.

0 MULTIPLAYING~
&B==========================================================================&C
Multiplaying is when a player has 2 or more of their characters logged on
to the MUD at the same time.  It is strictly prohibited to multiplay.  If
and when you are caught (and you WILL be caught), you will be asked to
stop.  If you are caught multiplaying a second time, all of the offending
characters will be deleted.  NO QUESTIONS ASKED!

1 MUSIC~
&B===========================================================================
&w
The music channel is used for open discussion upon lyrics, artists and singing
alike. It is not meant to be used as a way to bypass the filter for 'fun'.
Cursing/Swearing is allowed if it is in a song. If posting lyrics, have it in
the proper syntax, such as the following:

"We're stuck in a place you can hardly see..." - FRGT/10 (Alchemist Ft Chali 2NA)

Using the music channel is fine, but swearing is to be kept to an absolute
minimum. Songs featuring nothing but constant swearing isn't allowed.

Abide by these rules and enjoy happy music discussion.

~

52 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

MWHERE shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~

1 MYSTIC~
&R=======================================================================
&wFor lack of any real name, this technique has been dubbed 'mystic' by
all those to have seen it; due largely to its 'mystical' nature.
Different from all other sorts of powerlevel increasing techniques and
transformations, this skill works by giving a person a profound
understanding of their own power, enabling them to draw out part or all
of their hidden powers at will.

However, learning this technique comes at a cost. By learning to control
ones powers in such an effortless, serene way, they lose the ability to
use any other form of powerlevel increase they knew. But it is not a
permanent loss. If someone decides they no longer wish to know this way
of fighting, they can release the powers of mystic from their bodies, and
regain control over their previous power increasing abilities. It can
only be taught to someone by the Grand or Supreme Kaioshin (not the imm
kaioshins). Kaio's have this skill naturally, as it is a part of their
training as a kaio, so they are exempt from this rule.

Mystic works similar to the Super Namek ability, in that it is a modular
skill. You are able to choose to go to a pl mod between 1 and 20; each
mod increasing all of your stats by that amount (ie, mystic x20 = +20 to
all). Each 'step' requires an additional 250 energy to use. So at max,
it requires 5k energy. &GMystic can be learned by the following races:
Saiyan, Halfbreed, Human, Namek, and Kaio. Icers and Bio-Androids cannot,
as their power comes soley through physical, bodily mutations. Bio-androids
also cannot absorb this technique. Androids may not learn it since they
are machines. &wMystic requires a powerlevel of 100 billion to be learned.
Like super namek, you can go up and down in mods while in mystic at will,
simply by typing mystic (mod#). To power down from mystic, you can either
type powerdown, or mystic 0.

You have mastered yourself as far as mortally possible, and now
see immortality within your grasp...

Along with your new position you recieve a new channel, to use this
channel type ': <message>' or 'imm <message>'.
~

-1 M_BALZHUR_~
Suddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder...

The next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...

-1 M_GODLVL1_~
...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.
~

-1 M_GODLVL2_~
...You suddenly feel more confident and sure of yourself and your new
powers...

You feel that you have earned some trust and respect among your peers,
yet you know that your jouney has only just begun.
~

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy!

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...

You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL4_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful!

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...

You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

0 NAME NAMES~
&G-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&CWhen choosing a name, please try to choose one which is both sensible
and unique. Good names help add to gameplay and will allow you to forge
an identity for yourself. This is the most general rule to follow when
choosing your name: Do not make it something stupid, like a handle in
a chatroom. It should be something that a fictional character would
conceivably have as a real name.

Your name should not be found in the dictionary. This is not a constant rule.
If a word found in the dictionary is also a reasonable name, for example,
'Jewel' or 'Chase', then it will be acceptable. Names that fit in with a racial
theme from DBZ are also okay. For example, a namek named 'Viola,' or an icer
named 'Fridge.' If you want to play it safe, and save a possible hassle,
choose a name that is not a real word. It will most likely be legal.
Realistic names, such as "Joe", are legal.
Here are some guidelines as to what your name should &RNOT &Cbe:

 &W- &YUnpronounceable.
 &W- &YProfane or derogatory as interpreted in any language.
 &W- &YSimilar to that of any Immortal, location, major mob, or equipment.
 &W- &YSignificant in history, current events, mythology, or religion.
 &W- &YComprised of ranks or titles, such as 'Lord' or 'Master'.
 &W- &YAny character name from DB/DBZ/DBGT. (See help DBZNAMES)
 &W- &YAny of the above in reverse, i.e., writing Goku as Ukog.

&CPlease keep in mind that names which were authed in the past do
not validate current name authing. Above are the guidelines
which all immortals follow. In addition, they may have their own
reasons for denying your name.

&RThe final determination as to the validity of a name on DBS is at the
discretion of the Immortals and is NOT subject to debate or discussion.

&CIf your name is denied, simply follow the guidelines and try a new one.
Do not argue, as it is not going to help you.

This helpfile cannot possibly cover all circumstances. A name which may seem
illegal or legal by a literal reading of this file may be determined to be
otherwise by the administration. The primary rule is that the name be
reasonable.

-1 NAMEK NAMEKS NAMEKIAN NAMEKIANS~
&B===============================================================================&C
A race of warriors and healers that hail from Planet Namek, they are best
known for their strange green bodies.  They are able to manipulate their
forms in magnificent ways.  Nameks can stretch their arms to attack enemies
from far away, or even split themselves into two identical fighters.  They
can regenerate severed limbs with ease, and thus heal at an increased rate.
When Nameks recover the ancient knowledge of their brethren, the most powerful
of them become Super Nameks.

58 NEWBIE~
Newbiechat is a channel created for and use by only low-level new
players.  It is designed to lessen the confusion of their transition
into the Realms, and can be used to gain answers to any questions
or problems the player may have.

51 NEWBIESET~
Syntax: newbieset <character>

NEWBIESET puts the default (i.e. Darkhaven Academy) equipment into the
character's inventory.  Recipient must be level 5 or lower.
~

0 NEWCLAN~
&B=========================================================================&C
To start a new clan, you will need the following:

1)  Clan name.
2)  Short clan description 1 - 3 lines.
3)  Clan motto.
4)  Clan alignment (good, neutral, evil).
5)  Clan help file with a long clan description and how to join.  You
    can add any extra info that you want included as well.
6)  At least 10 players who will join.
7)  Three clan leaders.  These players do not count towards the 10
    memember requirement.
8)  An admin who will support your clan.
9)  Clan item with a detailed description for when you 'look' at it.
    This is usaly an insigniea or something else that destinguishes
    your clan and if someone sees it, they know what clan owns the
    item.

After you have all of this information, your clan admin will submit
it to be reviewed.  IF it is accepted the clan will be created.

See Also:  &WCLANS&D
~

50 'NEWCLAN APPLICATIONS'~
In all cases new clan applications would be taken the old way:

 - you find your three leaders (no shared leaders here)

 - you find at least two additional avatars
   ... need five avatars total start clan (3 leaders, 2 more)

 - your theme is approved by the conclave; approval is defined
   here as little more than a straining process for quality.
   If you have a theme you're willing to build on/around and
   play and it's not something like a clan that fights for the
   glory of Metallica you're probably okay

- you find a deity that's willing to help you in upkeeping
   the clan (i.e. be a mediator with other imms, help you get
   changes made, help you keep the theme of your clan going).
   You won't _have_ to have a deity all the time if it just
   really ends up that you can't keep one, but it's necessary
   to get started (though have pondered linking the function
   of certain clan bonuses such as healers, etc. to the clan
   having a deity, but that's a completely different matter)

NOTE:  This isn't to say an imm-created clan or clans may not be
       introduced, but any such clans would have stipulations on
       them and be for specific use, such as any assassin type of
       clan.  This isn't being planned, just covering bases here
~

50 'NEWCLAN EQ2'~
Equipment option 2:  self-created

Created via purchase by the clan.  Either gold or glory or both used
to add affects to the items up to a cap.  Items would start off with
no affects, or perhaps a very, very low set of base stats
 - cap would be raised occasionally to allow more power to be added
   if stock item power overtakes it
   NOTE:  There are new areas coming in that are going to have stock
          items better than existing stock items, and some will have
          items that give unusual rewards.  The difficulty will be
          astronomical, but the value is pretty high

Affects could also be removed and replaced at the will of the clan
(i.e. adjusting the item for a cost, remove hps and add some dr, etc.)
or even stripped completely by the clan I suppose if it really wanted
to screw everyone up who had their stuff.
 -  changes to affects could either be retroactive or new eq only,
    meaning when you change a bracer every bracer out there would
    receive that change, or that change would only affect new items
    made.  This is something that would be decided at inception.

Yes, cost would be high for affects, and we have not decided on a scale
yet.  It's very unlikely that even the existing clans could foot the
bill for a set of eq comparable even to old clan stuff in a short time.
It's meant that it'll be a slower process, though I'm sure someone will
surprise us.  The advantages are a rising cap over time, the control to
adjust stats as you want and can afford, and that the eq will likely
be more powerful when capped than the divinated eq would be.

-1 NEW_DEATH~
...Everything begins to fade to black.  You feel yourself leaving your body.
Rising up into the air, you feel more free than you have ever felt before...

However, before your deity comes to collect your soul, you feel a strange
pulling sensation as strange and colorful mists swirl around you...

&CA low voice fills your head with words of advice...
"When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the cathedral of Notre
 Dame de Sioux in New Darkhaven; should you one day become a member of a
 clan, guild or order you will be returned to your own altar."

"Your corpse, however, is left behind where you were killed, together with
 all of your equipment, so that you can attempt to return to the scene and
 loot your corpse.  Your gold stays with you.  Corpses decay after time,
 and when this happens the objects inside will decay with it."

"Once you have chosen a deity and gained sufficient favor, you may be able
 to supplicate to your deity for your corpse.  Type '&Whelp death&C' for more
 information.  This message will appear only on your first two deaths..."

USAGE - 'note (command) [number or text]'
   (command) can be any of the following:
    List, Read, Write, Subject, To, Show, Post, Remove, Take, Date.
   [number or text] can be left blank, be a number, or be words
    depending on what (command) you use.  Usage is explained below.

LIST - Lists the notes you can read. List [number] lists all the notes
 including, and after [number]. You must be at a note board to List.
 example: 'note list'    shows all notes on the board.
          'note list 10' shows notes 10 and later on the board.

READ - Displays the contents of [number]. You must be at a note board to
 Read, and you must specify a [number].
 example: 'note read 5' displays note #5.

WRITE - Puts you in an editor where you can write a note. You must be
 holding a note, and have a quill in your inventory to Write.
 example: 'note write' puts you in the editor. See Help EDITOR.

See Also:  &WGBOARD GNOTE BOARD NOTE2
~

0 NOTE2~
&B===========================================================================&C
SUBJECT - Sets the subject line of a new note to [text]. You must be
 holding a note, and have a quill in your inventory to set the Subject.
 example: 'note subject Hello World!' sets Hello World! as the subject.

TO - Sets the recipient(s) to [text]. ALL means all players. IMMORTAL
 means all immortals. You must be holding a note, and have a quill.
 example: 'note to Harakiem' sets Harakiem as the note's recipient.

SHOW - displays a note you are holding.

REMOVE - erases note [number] from a note board. You must be at a note
 board and be the note's author or an immortal to use Remove.
 example: 'note remove 12' removes note #12, if you're its author.

TAKE - similar to 'Remove' but places the note in your inventory, rather
 than completely erasing it.
 example: 'note take 10' moves note 10 to your inventory from the board.

DATE - similar to 'list' but replaces who the message is to with the
 date that the note was written.

51 NOTELL NOEMOTE NOTITLE SILENCE UNSILENCE~
Syntax: notitle <character>
Syntax: noemote <character>
Syntax: notell  <character>
Syntax: silence <character>
Syntax: unsilence <character>

NOTITLE, NOEMOTE, NOTELL, and SILENCE are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from setting their title, emoting, telling, and using
channels, respectively.  Characters who are notelled will also not recieve
those forms of communication.

Use UNSILENCE to remove a player's silence.  Simple use notell, noemote or
notitle on the character again to remove each of those restrictions.

54 'NUISANCE STAGES'~
Stages of nuisances are the affects that the victim picks up while in
that stage.  As time progresses and the victim progresses through the
stages, they pick up new problems and the old ones gradually strengthen.
So for example if they are in stage 3 and progress to stage 4.  They
will feel more affects from stage 1,2 and 3 and pick up the affects from
stage 4. Power level is how hard they get hit with the affect. So if in stage
1 the affect was 2% of the time at power level 1 it may be 4% of the time
in power level 2.  And in stage 2 the affect in stage 1 may be 4% of the
time at power level 1 and 8% of the time at power level 2.
So with that being said here are the current stages and their affects:
Stage 1:  The Thirst Stage
          This makes them become thirsty quicker.  The formula used is the
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is added to your
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is subtracted from
your thirst each time.  With 100 being not thirsty and 0 being dehydrated.
Stage 2:  The Hunger Stage
          The hunger stage works exactly as above except, the formula
subtracts 1 from the current stage becoming: (<current stage>-1)*<power level>
Stage 3:  The Mentalstate Stage
          In this stage each time your mentalstate worsens nuisance exagerates
the amount you worsen by. The formula used to compute how much more it
adds or subtracts is: .4*(<current stage>-2)*<power level>.
Stage 4:  The Potion Stage
          In this stage you can not stomach as many potions as you normally
could without the nuisance flag.  Normally if your thirst or hunger is above
48 you can't quaf anymore.  Nuisance makes this a much lower number.
The formula used is: (48-(3*<current stage>)+<power level>)
So at power level 10, stage 10 you could only quaf 8 potions on an empty
stomach.
Stage 5:  The Wait Stage
          In this stage commands start taking longer to complete.  A
normal spell for example takes around 8-15 rounds of wait time.  With this
stage more wait time is added with the following formula:
(<current stage> -4 ) + <power level>    So at Stage 6 at power level 5,
each command would have an additionl 7 wait added to it.
Stage 6:  The Offensive Magic Stage
           In this stage you have a chance of targeting yourself with
offensive spells instead of whatever target is specified.  The formula
for the percentage or the time you do it is the following:
(<current stage>-5)*8 + <power_level>*6  So at first stage 6 with a power
level of 5 you would have a 38% chance to target yourself with offensive
spells.
Stage 7:  The Defensive Magic Stage
          In this stage, if you are fighting someone you have a chance to
target them with any defensive spells you cast.  The formula used is the
following:  (<current stage>-6)*8 + <power_level>*6
Continued in help 'NUISANCE STAGES2'
~

54 'NUISANCE STAGES2'~
Stage 8:  The Speech Stage
          In this stage you have a chance to scramble your speech and
scramble other peoples speech (IE what you hear from them).  This works
on a percentage with the following formula:
(<current stage>-7)*10*<power level>  So at stage 9 with power level 2
speech is scrambled 40% of the time.
Stage 9:  The Movement Stage
            In this stage you start moving in random directions like a drunk
does.  This is worked out in a percentage as well. Which works of the
following formula:  (<current stage>-8)*10*<power level>  So in stage 10
with a power level of 4 you would randomly choose an exit 80% of the time.
Stage 10:  The command Stage
           In this stage your commands start failing (Like mentalstate).
This is done on a percentage of the following:
(<current stage>-9)*10*<power level>  So at stage 10, power level 10 the
character becomes utterly useless, as commands will fail 100% of the time.

&B==========================================================================&C

Below is a list of basic rules. By entering this MUD you agree that you
have both read them and have AGREED to follow them. DO NOT use the excuse
you have not read the rules, as you claim you have in the Newbie Tutoral
Area.

&WNO BOTTING&C:                       1st Offence - Character botting
(&Bhelp botting&C)                                  will be deleted.

&WNO HARASSING PLAYERS OR ADMINS&C:   1st Offence:
(&Bhelp harassment&C)                     Verbal  - Silenced for 1 - 8 hours.
                                      Phycial - Helled for 1 - 8 hours.
                                  2nd Offence (either):
                                      Helled and silenced for 1 - 8 hours.

&WNO ABUSING BUGS&C:                  Helled until a level 65 admin can rule
(&Bhelp bugs&C)                       on the case.

&WNO MULTIPLAYING&C:                  Deletion of all the offenders characters.
(&Bhelp multiplaying&C)

&WNO CREATING NEW CHARACTERS TO SURCOMVENT PUNISHMENTS&C:
                                  1st Offence:  Deletion of new characters
                                                and the original punishment
                                                will be doubled.
                                  2nd Offence:  IP banning for 1 week.

Muling (&BHELP MULING&C) is not condoned by the administrative staff.
Because of this, any lost items can not and will not be reimbursed to the
player in question.  Mule at your own risk!

You are expected to follow the spirit of the law, as well as the letter.
Please use common sense when playing and interacting with others.
Nothing irritates the administrative staff more than dealing with players
who say things like: "Well... you never SAID it was a bug... So how did i
KNOW it was a bug?"  As stated previously, use common sense, and if
you're unsure about something, ask an administrator... politely.

&WNOTE&C:  You are responsible for your character, the excuse that your
brother, sister, friend, evil voice inside your head, etc... did it, does
not excuse you from punishment if your character violates the rules.
}R
Administrators may decide to give a verbal warning instead of punishing
players.  Deciding to punish a player is ALWAYS at the admins descression.

1 OMC "OOZARU MOUTH CANNON"~
&R=======================================================================
&wThis attack is one of the most powerful moves possessed by those with
saiyan blood. The attack is one that pretty much invented itself. All
people with saiyan blood that are capable of transforming know this move,
although only subconciously. Once transformed, a person with saiyan blood
can use this move, and does so, quite often. Concentrating a vast amount
of power within the pit of their stomach and then vomiting it out, the
transformed saiyan can fire a blast of energy with incredible power at
an opponent. The damage range for this move is somewhat random, and is
between a final flash blast, and a big bang kamehameha blast. Oozaru
mouth cannon costs no energy to use, as while in the Oozaru state a
saiyan's ki energy is never-ending. The focus cost for this move is
equal to one fifth of the saiyans current int. Ie, if your int is 10,
the focus cost is 2. If your int is 100, the focus cost is 20. Etc etc.

0 OMEGAALLIANCE OA~
&B==================================================================&C
Long ago, a powerful warrior by the name of Tregorn noticed a rise in the
powers of evil in the universe.  Two clans of powerful, evil warriors particularly
caught his attention  :  the United Council and the Special Forces. He knew it
would only be a matter of time before they spread their evil influence throughout
the entire universe. Thus, he sprang into action, forming a clan of his own.  A
force of purity and good, built to oppose the ever growing evil powers.  This
clan was dubbed the Omega Alliance.

Much to everyone's surprise, Tregorn did not take the position of leader
for himself.  He appointed Link, a powerful halfbreed, to be the commanding
officer. When Link had decided his time had come to retire, he appointed
Cuse to his posistion. Now a mighty warrior by the name of Qrsu leads the
Omega Alliance with an iron fist. They fight to crush the forces of evil and
bring peace to the universe...no matter the cost.

As long as they prove themselves worthy, all races are accepted into the Omega
Alliance.  They travel throughout the universe, fighting against evil whereever
it may be found.  Their motto - Ludus Finivit Ergo Bibamus - means "The game
is over, therefore we drink."  After victories, they celebrate as if they had just
saved the world, which may very well be the case sometimes.

This clan is for good aligned characters of any race.
The minimum base powerlevel requirement is 100 million.

~

53 OMENU~
Syntax: omenu <object name> [menu page] (defaults to 'a' if none given)

Omenu will bring you into a menu system of editing objects.  To use omenu,
you must be holding the object that you are editing in your inventory.  To
choose an option in the menu, type the number of the section followed by the
desired letter, and any variables that may follow.

See MENU for generic menu commands.
~

1 OOZARU GOLDENOOZARU~
&R==========================================================================
&wA special trait of the Saiyan race is that of their monkey-like tails.
However, while it may seems harmless to the common observer, these tails
are the secret behind a power transformation. All people with Saiyan blood
are usually born with these tails, although the likelyness goes down with
dilution (Ie, Pan, who was a 1/4th saiyan, had no tail). As long as a
Saiyan possesses a tail, they are able to transform into what is called the
Oozaru state, when looking at a full moon. This is due to a special chemical
released into the body by the tail, triggered by a special type of light
wave frequency given off by the full moon.

Transforming into an Oozaru multiplies a persons powerlevel by 10, but has
no stat mods. While transformed, a saiyan cannot speak normally, nor can
it act normally in some respects, such as being able to wear/remove items.
However, while transformed, a Saiyan can use the oozaru mouth cannon, an
incredibly powerful and formidable attack.

There is also a more powerful version of this transformation. It is referred
to as Golden Oozaru, due to the fur and eyes of the transformed saiyan
resembling the golden hair and eyes of a super saiyan. In order to transform
in a Golden Oozaru, a Saiyan must first master the Super Saiyan 3 technique
(getting it to 100%). If they have done so, then the next time the Saiyan
is at its base pl during a full moon, the Saiyan will transform into a
Golden Oozaru, rather than a normal Oozaru. Becoming a Golden Oozaru is also
the key to attaining the final form for Saiyans, SSJ4. Because of this,
halfbreeds are unable to transform into Golden Oozaru. Golden Oozaru is
the strongest possible powerlevel multiplier in the game (even moreso than
a Demon in the evil overload state during the makeo star), multiplying the
Saiyans powerlevel by 35.

53 OPSTAT~
Syntax: opstat <object/object vnum>

Opstat will display all of the objprograms that have been written for the
specified object.  If a copy of the object exists in the game, it can be
accessed by its vnum.

1 ORDER~
&B===========================================================================&C
Syntax: order <person> <action>

Order is used to control Majins, split/tri/multi-form copies, Juniors, and
pets. It makes the person who is ordered to do the <action> do it just as
if they typed it in themself.

See Also:  &WSPLITFORM&D
~

51 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on

If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.

Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.

If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.

OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives

0 OUTCAST~
&B=======================================================================&C
If you leave a clan, or, are banished from a clan with a good reason,
you become an 'Outcast'. Outcasts cannot rejoin another clan.  There
should be  little reason to leave a clan, the clan theme and rules
are made clear to  you before you join the clan and you accept those
rules. If the clan is not  being run as stated, this is a different
issue that will be dealt with.  Outcast status *can* be removed but
this will be a very expensive process  costing 75K zeni per rank.

or she is the only person who can spar you or enter the Time Chamber with
you (until you pick a new partner!).

0 PASSWORD~
&B============================================================================&C
syntax 'password <old> <new> <again>'

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  You repeat the new password only.
If you do not get it correctly it will not work.  This should end the typo
locking you out of your character.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it.  It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.

Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess.  We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length.  A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.

NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are not responsible for ensuring fair trades.  You may seek an
immortal to oversee a trade, but it is not their  responsibility.

0 PASSWORD_ZMUD~
&B============================================================================&C
When you're using zMUD and want to change your password, remember to change
it in the zMUD character settings as well as on the mud.  The MUD's command
for this is:  password <new password> <new password>
In zMUD, click on 'File', then 'Another Character', or 'File', then 'Open'
to access the character settings - and change the password there.
If you have forgotten your character's password but can still log on with
the character, you can still find out what the password is.  Log on with
that character, click on 'View', then 'Preferences' and then click on
General Settings'.  Find the checkbox for 'Gag Password' and make sure the
box is not checked.  Click on 'Ok' to close the dialog box.
Type the command #say %pass [enter].  Your password will be shown on your
screen, but not sent to the mud.  Write it down, for future reference.

be used before the foreground color. Also, the last color setting in your
prompt will wash over into the text you type. So, if you want a set
of colors for your typed text, include that at the end of your prompt set.

Example (assuming current h.p.'s of 43 and mana of 23):

Prompt &&Y^^b<%h/&&x^^r%m>&&w^^x = <43/23>
        {A}     {B}       {C}

A) Yellow with blue background.

1) A good person killing another good person is a serious offence.
   You alignment will instantly be turned evil.  How evil you become
   will depend on how good the player was you killed.
2) You should have a decent (rp) reason to kill someone.  However,
   it is not required.
3) You may only kill players with a yellow or red PK or WAR flag.
   Hardcore players are considered to be PK red at all time.

   you attack a player.  It doesn't matter if you can't attack them
   or if they kill you.
5) You don't have to have a PK flag on to kill someone, you will
   automaticly aquire their colored flag when you try to kill them.
6) If you try to attack someone with out a PK or WAR flag on them
   you will automaticly have a yellow PK flag put on you.

1 POTARAFUSION POTARA~
&R========================================================================-
&wThe gift from the Old Kai to Goku, the Potara Earrings serve as a method
of fusion that is superior to the fusion dance that Goku learned while in
the afterlife.  For two people to fuse together, one simply puts an earring
on their right ear, and the other puts it on their left.  Their bodies are
instantly pulled toward each other and fused together.  While it may be
more powerful than the fusion dance, the potara fusion has no time limit,
meaning that once fused, you can never become seperate again.

Once you have two potara earrings (a right and a left one), and someone you
want to fuse with, you must contact a level 63 or higher admin and state
that you wish to fuse with someone.  You will then be taken to a private
room, where you and your friend will be instructed to wear the earrings in
the proper order (whoever has the earring on the right ear will control the
resulting character.  The person wearing the left earring will be
permanently frozen), afterwhich the admin will use the potarafusion command
on you, fusing the two of you together.

Fusion races are different from the normal races.  They are named in a way
that denotes what the primary race of the fusion is.

Example: "Saiyan-N" would mean the primary race is Saiyan, the secondary is
Namekian.

The fused character will have all the skills and transformations of the
primary race, and will have all the skills of the secondary race, but none
of the transformations or special skills (such as preservation).

0 POWERLEVEL PL~

Your powerlevel is a rating of your over all strength, speed, and
skill level.  The higher your powerlevel the better you get at
fighting.  You can increase your powerlevel by fighting or training
in a gravity chamber.

0 POWERUP POWERDOWN~
&B==========================================================================&C
Syntax: 'powerup' - Powers up once
        'powerdown' - Powers down to your base PL

All races possess the ability to powerup, boosting their powerlevel. While
in this state, you will take less damage, be more likely to dodge, and even
hit more often. Please note that you may not count your maxpl (that which
you possess while powered up), when trying to learn skills. For example,
to learn kick or punch, you must have 5000 PL before powering up. Most races
have other ways to increase their max pl. Check your racial file for info
on this. Powerup and racial forms do not work together, if you use a racial
form, powerup will not further increase your PL. You start with the ability
to powerup once, and gain additional powerups when your PL reaches certain
points. These are as follows:

        2       100,000         |       5       1,000,000
        3       250,000         |       6       2,000,000

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and abilities available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or ability.  Your learning
percentage starts off at 0% (unlearned), and can be practiced once.
After this initial practice, the skill/spell must be used to develop it
to the level of 'adept' (Adept is not always necessarily 100%)  You must
be at a master to practice.

You do not need practice points to practice skills or abilities.  You
only need the base power level that is required to learn the skill or
abilitiy.

&B===========================================================================&C
Aliens from the planet Namek reproduce asexually.  That is, without a

take affect whenever a Namek dies, lowering how much PL they lose and
letting them hatch from the egg near their corpse.

0 PROMOTE DEMOTE ROSTER~
&B==========================================================================&C
Syntax: promote <name> <leader/number1/number2>
Syntax: demote <name>
Syntax: roster <alpha/kills/deaths>

The promote command allows clan admin's and leader's to do all the in-clan
promotion tasks.  This allows clan leaders to promote and demote players in
a much more promply fasson.  Now you don't have to wait for an admin to do it
for you.

Usage of the promote command is pretty simple.  If you wish to stay in the
clan, but you don't want to be the leader any more, you can use the 'leader'
option.  It will make who ever you chose leader and demote you do a normal
clan member.  The new leader then get's the power to use the promote command.

You can also, as you can guess, demote people.  The last power clan
leaders have is 'roster'.  This will show a list of people who are in your
clan.  You can sort the list by name, kills, or deaths with the arguments.

0 PROMPT FPROMPT~
&B================================================================================&C
Syntax:   prompt  <string>
Syntax:   fprompt <string>

Sets your prompt to a given string.  The game automatically sets your prompt
when your character is created, but you can use PROMPT to change your prompt
to more to your liking.  If you type 'default' as the string, your prompt
will be set back to the game default.

The fprompt sets your fighting prompt.  This is the prompt that is displayed
to you while you are fighting.  It follows the same format as the normal
prompt does.
Your prompt can be any string of characters that you wish. You can also embed
special characters and tokens into the string that you set. These special
characters are linked with specific groups of tokens. These tokens will add
specific sets of information to your prompt.

The first special character is:  %
Tokens for % are:
  %h  - current hitpoints                %m  - current mana (0 for vamp)
  %H  - maximum hitpoints                %M  - maximum mana (0 for vamp)
  %b  - current blood (0 for non-vamp)   %v  - current movement
  %B  - maximum blood (0 for non-vamp)   %V  - maximum movement
  %g  - gold held                        %x  - current experience
  %a  - your alignment                   %X  - experience needed to next level
  %A  - invisible/hide/sneak indicator   %S  - your current combat style

The other special characters are:
 &&  - Foreground color                  ^^  - Background color

Examples (assuming current hit points of 43, mana of 23, and movement of 120):
Prompt %h%m%v       =   4323120
Prompt <%h|%m|%v>>> =   <43|23|120>>>
Prompt %h %m %v     =   43 23 120

1 PROXY~
&B==================================================================================&C
While a proxy itself is of little harm, the ways in which they are used on this mud
requires that we take action. We are now actively searching for users that use proxies
and those that we catch using proxies will have their characters deleted. Should
a proxy be used in mass, it will be banned.

We are also aware that this is a difficult task, and that it is likely the proxy users
will laugh at us, thinking we can't catch them. We can, and we will. Whether a Fighter
in training, or a North Kai, you will eventually be caught, and your character will
be deleted. So before you think about using a proxy, weigh how much you value your
character.

Other types include Vacuum, Slip, Coldwind, Sinkhole, Landslide,
Quicksand, Earthquake, Undefined, Lava, Hotair and Breeze (objects only).

The frequency of the push is controlled by the value set in
redit push <force>, and may be anything from -100 to 100. Positive
and negative values represent pulling and pushing, respectively.
The more positive (or negative) the number is, the sooner the force
will push or pull you.
~

0 PUNCH KICK~
&B=========================================================================&C
Anybody can throw a punch, or swing their foot out towards someone.
But to kick or punch someone in a way that does actual damage requires
skill.  At a rather low powerlevel any race can learn how to punch and
kick with more force, thereby giving themselves and extra attack.  All
they have to do is type 'punch' or 'kick' and the attack will be
performed.  Be warned though, that these are not the most powerful or
useful of skills.

Kicking or punching costs only 2 focus and 15 energy.

&CBelow is a list of common crimes and their punishments on Dragonball Saga.

&RWHETHER OR NOT THESE EXACT PUNISHMENTS ARE GIVEN IS UP TO THE SOLE
DISCRETION OF THE IMM GIVING THE PUNISHMENT, AND CAN ONLY BE OVERTURNED
OR CHANGED BY AN IMM OF A HIGHER LEVEL.&C

Filter Evasion: 30 minute silence
Botting: Infinite helling and/or deletion of character(s) involved
Player Harassment:
        -- if verbal: 15 minute silence
        -- if physical: ....yeah right. You can't physically harass someone
           over the internet. Duh.

Bug Abuse: depends on severity of bug (see level 60+ imm for ruling)
Ban Evasion: banning of new IP(s), existing bans doubled
Spamming:
        -- if socials and emotes: 30 minutes noemote
        -- if channels: 30 minute silence
        -- if boards: 3 days nognote

Punishment Evasion: 3 days in hell of offending char, possible increase in
    the punishment of the originally punished char.
Bashing an Admin: 15 minute silence
Player Bashing: 15 minute silence
Multiplaying: deletion of all characters involved
Scamming: name placed on the scammer list, possibly 7-14 days helling,
  as well as a reimbursement of the players scammed, and a penalty
  to the offenders zeni and items.
Linkdead Abuse: 2 days in hell
Racism or Discrimination: 1 hour silence
Alt Revenge: 1 week helling for both characters
Swearing in gnotes:
        -- if moderate amount and non-abusive: nothing.
        -- if heavy amount and/or abusive: 1 day nognote

Punishments not listed here will be up to the admin's own discretion.
Admin's also have the authority to exceed the punishments stated, though
not beyond reason, if they feel it is appropriate.  In general, the only
reasons the punishments would be more severe are the reasons below.

Repeated offenders can expect their punishments to increase each time.

Criminal record can, but not always will be, taken into account when
punishments are given. For example, if you have two accounts of player
harassment, an account of admin bashing, and an account of linkdead abuse,
and then you evade punishment, you can possibly expect the number of days
in hell to be longer.

All punishments are commented in your player file and can only be seen by
imms.

&WSeptember 30, 2004 &C[post chaos clean up]
---

For those of you who are unaware of what a pwipe is, or what it entails,
it is the general deletion of all current player files. This is usually
done for one or more reasons. Sometimes, new code will be implemented
that requires a slightly different format in player files. Pwipes can
also be initiated to give equal chances to everyone after a change in
the code. Another reason for a pwipe is to eliminate the effects caused
by a bug.  If you find a bug, do not attempt to test it again (or tell
others), do not go around abusing something that might possibly be a bug,
even if the staff has not said it is a bug. We may not have informed you
because we do not know of it ourselves. Please notify us using the global
bug board (HELP GBOARD). This will possibly save you from having to deal
with Pwipes.

As you can see from the pwipe history, they do not happen often here.  We
try very hard to prevent player wipes from having to occur, but some
times there is no other choice.  When pwipes do occur, we can not and
will not give any reimbursements to players.  So don't even bother asking.

51 QPSET~
This command is used for giving/taking Glory from players.  The syntax
is as follows:

      qpset <player>  <give|take>  <amount>

Where one of give or take is used, and the amount is always a positive
integer.

Please see HELP GLORYIMM before affecting a player's Glory.
See also: GLORYIMM2, GLORY, GLORY RATES.
~

51 QPSTAT~
syntax ( qpstat target)

This command will show information regarding the amount of glory a
player has. The first number is their current glory, the second is
the amount of glory held over lifetime.

0 QUEST~
&B=============================================================================&C
Syntax: QUEST <message>

The quest channel is one which is typically used when a quest is being
run, to notify players who are involved as to new updates.

Quests are held at the whim of Immortals. If you are using the Quest channel
to ask if there is a quest, you are probably too late to enter. Simply keep
the channel on and wait for an Immortal's announcement, should there be one.
~

0 QUIT~
&B===========================================================================&C
Syntax: QUIT

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room, unless that room has a prog that moves
you upon re-entry.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just
one command.  Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you
get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other
mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

1 RACISM~
&B========================================================================
&CRacism is not tolerated here in any way, shape, or form.  Any racist
remark that is reported by another player will be investigated.  Any
investigation that yields a positive result will be punished.  This may be
a game, but you all are expected to act with a degree of maturity on public
channels that you must show in a high school cafeteria.

The punishment for anyone being racist is a forty-eight hour silence.
Should you switch alts after being punished to complain, the punishment
will be extended.  You have absolutely no right to complain after you've
been racist.

It's neither morally right, nor is it legal.  You *can* get fired from a
job for being racist to your co-workers.  And should repeated trends of
racism occur from a particular person, this person will be removed from the
game (ie, banned).  Don't think this to be a joking matter, because it's
not.&D
~

1 RAILGUN~
&R=======================================================================
&wAn experimental attack, and undoubtably one of the strongest possessed
by the android race. This weapon can only be used by type FM androids,
due to the mechanical and energy generation requirements of the device.
In order to be used, the android turns its arm into a rail launcer. The
hand is retracted, then the arm is seperated into two parrallel halves.
The android charges energy into the gap between these two halves, which
essentially act like a small version of a high powered electro magnet;
and begins spinning the arm at the same time to boost power generation
effect. A small energy spike is created, which is then accelerated to a
blindlingly high speed in an instant and shot towards the android's
opponent. This attack can cause severe damage, and even has a low
chance of instantaneous death. Railgun costs 25,000 energy, 50 focus,
and 10 SD charges to use.

51 RAP~
This command allows you to rap on a closed passageway and anyone on the
other side will "hear" it.  The message sent is an act_message, and
act_progs can be trigger by it.
~

58 RAT~
Syntax: rat vnum1 vnum2 command [parameters]

Rat, or 'range at' is the at command with the added parameters of two
room vnums.  Assuming the vnums are valid, your 'at' command will be
executed in every room in the range you give.

Example: rat 100 110 redit flags 0
This will clear the room flags in all rooms from 100 to 110 inclusive.
~

58 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK~
Syntax: reboot <nosave>
Syntax: shutdown <nosave>
Syntax: wizlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 51 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,
may reconnect.

If nosave is specified for reboot or shutdown, it will not automatically
save all of the players.

0 RECORD~
&B==========================================================================
&w
The Record. Something people wish to have very little of. The higher your
record, the more severe your next punishment will be. It's advised that
you attempt to keep a very -LOW- record on the game, otherwise you're subject
to punishments that are very costly...

 - 5 Comments: 2.5 mil Zeni deduction from Pfile.
 - 7 Comments: 5 mil Zeni deduction from Pfile.
 - 10 Comments: 1 -Digit- off your powerlevel.*
 - 12 Comments: Immortal Roulette.**

Long story short, Don't get comments. It's not good for your playing ability...

*Digit means 1 single digit. You have 11 tril base, you'll have 1 tril base.
**Immortal Roulette means they get to decide what happens...

53 REDIT~
Syntax: REDIT FIELD [parameter list]
        REDIT ON

FIELD  | PARAMETERS             -- DESCRIPTION / NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------
name   | <room name>            -- sets the room name / short description
exit   | <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keywords]
bexit  | same as above, but does the exit in both directions
desc   | none                   -- you will be placed into the buffer editor
exdesc | <direction> [text]     -- sets/clears an exit's description
ed     | <keyword(s)>           -- adds/edits an extra description to the room
rmed   | <keyword(s)>           -- removes an extra description from the room
sector | <value>                -- sets the sector type
flags  | <flag> [flag]          -- toggles room flags
exflags| <direction> [flags]    -- displays/toggles exit flags
exname | <direction> [keywords] -- sets an exit's keywords
exkey  | <direction> <key vnum> -- sets an exit's key vnum/value

Note: Put a '+' before the direction to force ADDing of that exit
      and use a '#' to specify the exit by sequential order.

REDIT ON will lock you into a mode in which 'redit' is implied in each command
sequence, and hitting enter will give you an instant rstat of whichever room
you are in at the time. To get out of REDIT ON, simply type the word DONE.
Example:

        redit on
        name A dark and forboding hallway
        flags dark indoors
        done

1 REGENERATION~
&R===========================================================================
&wBio-Android's bodies are specificy engineered, on a cellular level, to work
on a principle of operating independantly and cooperatively at the same time.
Combined with the namekian ability to regenerate ones body, this design
allows Bio-Android's to fully regenerate their body, as long as a single cell
survives. This, like the namekian skill "preservation", cuts down the pl
losses a Bio-Android incurs upon death. Regeneration has a powerlevel
requirement of 75 million.
~

0 REIMBURSE~
&B==========================================================================&C
Since this server is still in development stage, it means that from time
to time, players will be subjected to bugs and malfunctions. So sometimes
people will either lose or gain an awful lot of powerlevel, ki or anything
else.

Immortals will not and do not have to reimburse you at any time, it is
totally up to the immortal whether they will give or take your new pl.
Do NOT expect immortals to reimburse you, this will only get you helled or
banned, depending on how persistant you are.

If an immortal decides to reimburse you, that is a priviledge and should be
treated as such, not a right.

In case you either gain or lose something due to a bug, please report this to
the immortals, if you deal with it in a professional way you are very likely to
get your powerlevel reimburseed or a reward!

0 REMNANT~
&B==============================================================================&C
Hundreds of years ago there was a group of warriors dedicated to nothing
but destruction and mayhem.  Their powers were felt everywhere, their
presence felt in the hearts of foes.  This group was known as The Shenkai
Aurei.  They slaughtered their foes without mercy, and they were feared
throughout the galaxy.  In the days of the Galactic war they stayed
neutral, not wanting to become puppets of either government.  The Oroki
wanted the mystic warriors on their side, they wanted them at all costs,
but since they couldnt have them, they sent their own group of assassins to
eliminate the Shenkai Aurei.  The warriors would not be decieved.  They
ambushed the assassins and killed them all.  This attempt to eliminate them
infuriated them, and so they decided to join the Akusha, the Oroki's sworn
enemy.  They fought valiantly by the Akushas side, killing many of their
enemies.  Their leader Link knew that they were winning the war, yet he
felt that somehow it would all change.  He decided to take in new members.
The new recruits all did well in their training, yet one excelled above
all. His name was Clerve.  Link knew that this disciple of his would change
the course of the war.  Before he could finish Clerve's training, the enemy
launched a deadly assault on the Aurei's home planet.  The Aurei faught
gallantly, killing over half of the enemy which outnumbered them one
hundred to one, but they could not match the sheer numbers that the Oroki
threw against them.  They retreated to their most sacred city where the
final battle was fought.  The battle was decisive, and almost all of the
Aurei were slaughtered, their bodies piling up in the streets of their holy
city.  Even Link was slain in the huge battle.  Clerve was seperated from
the rest and injured.  He thought he was about to die, but somehow tapped
into a reserve of power and slaughtered all of the invaders, to the last
man.  He returned to his few remaining people a legend, a hero.  He
gathered his friends Lisker and Xanus with him and started on a journey to
revenge their fallen.  They were all that's left, they are The Remnant of
what once was, but will never be again.

To join this clan you must have a minumum PL of 50 million, and 5 pks.

0 REPAIR~
&B============================================================================&C
During fights, armor will slowly be damaged by the powerful blows of your
enemies.  Certain shops on the MUD will let you repair your armor, for a
fee of course.  Just type 'repair <item>' to repair a certain item, or
'repair all' to repair everything in your inventory.  A surcharge will be
added on if you use the second option, for the convenience of having
all your armor repaired at the same time.

and the current local time for the host computer.

WEATHER shows the current game weather.  You must be in an outside room
to see the weather.
~

51 RESERVE~
.
The "Reserve" command enables us to specify certain names that are
reserved and cannot be used by players.

We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms (like Narn and Dominus). We can specify names that are
often tried and are a bit of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).

We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*">
e.g.  reserve *goof
This will prevent any name with the substring "goof" ... like ...
"goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.

reserve                        list current reserved names
reserve joe                    add joe to the list if he's not on it
reserve joe                    remove joe to the list if he is on it
reserve *goof                  add the substring "goof" to the list

killers and any who happen to be in the arena.

A note on RESTORE ALL: This is a gift from the gods, and it is never
planned in advance or done on request.  The best way to ensure that a
restore all will NOT be done is to ask for one.
~

53 RESTORETIME~
Restoretime shows you how much time has passed since you last did a
restore all. All Immortals between the levels of 53 and 56 can do one
restore all per 18 hours of Real Time. Those of level 57+ can restore

~

1 ROCKETPUNCH DOUBLEROCKETPUNCH~
&R=======================================================================
&wThe modular design of type FM androids gives them some unique battle
advantages over other android types. Hidden within their arms are
powerful rockets that are powered by the androids own energy. In battle,
an android can order the arm to detach and fire at its opponent to cause
damage, then retrieve the arm mid-flight and reattach it, whereafter the
move can be repeated if the android decides to. This move was used by
android 16 during his fight with Cell.

The move rocket punch fires only one arm at the opponent, costing 275
energy, and 15 focus.

The move double rocket punch fires both arms at the opponent, costing
1500 energy and 25 focus.

1 RPFUSION~
&B================================================================================&C

1. Both people who want to fuse should be at least at or above 200k base.
2. Both fused people will post after their fusion partner posts twice.
3. The two fusioned can make decisions of how or what to post, as if having one personality. The personality of the fused character, too will be decided on the two people fused.
4. The character resulting from the fusion will have the base that comes from the formula (base+base)*compabilitymod (see below)
5. The fusion can only last for fifteen posts.
6. Everyone must do the original fusion dance, no exceptions.
7. All races can fuse, but there are compability issues involved, explained in more detail below.
8. Fusions cannot be instant, there must be the original dance involved to fuse.
9. Both who want to fuse must each execute one post of the dance with each other to fuse.
10. The dance too can be executed swiftly with skill, as to avoid being hit during the dance.
11. You need 35 overall rpp and have to have learned the dance from someone else to be able to use it.
12. The fusion can have any variation of physical appearance or clothing.  However, everything MUST logically result from the two people who fuse.  This means two light skinned humans with blue hair will not result in a dark skinned
fusion with yellow hair.
13. After the fusion time alotted, the two who want to fuse must wait for twenty posts.
14. The fusioned name is chosen by the two characters who want to fuse regardless of pl bases, and must be easily discernable as a combination of their names.
15. Posts must be executed as such 'chat *Gokilsai grins with overexuberant confidence.'
16. If a post is too big to fit in the writing buffer, you may continue it in a second message, but it may only be one or two lines long. Any longer and it will count as a seperate note toward your total.
17. Fusioned characters can mix and match moves, though the transformations for the character will always come from the stronger person in the fusion.  Example : stronger Human + weaker Saiyan = can use Hyper and BBK,
but only if the weaker one is strong enough to use their contributing moves while unfused.
18. You must have an immortal roll dice before fusing to see if you fail or not, by using: rp *dice 10.
19. 1-9 you fuse succesfully, 10 you don't.
20. Fusion rules and facts subject to change...
21. Contact Nilsai with any suggestions/problems regarding RP fusion so as that we may make it better.
22. Fusion is cool.


RP fusion compability chart:
Human/Saiyan/Halfbreed/Android
Bio/Namek/Icer/Android


A normal fusion with someone in your category : (base + base) * 3 = fusion base
A fusion with one not in your category would be : (base + base) * 2 = fusion base
For a failed fusion, equal chance to get the old, skinny version or fat version : (base + base) * .25 = fusion base


Fusion idea copyright to Nilsai.
Thanks especially go to Viola for providing most of the formulas for fusions.  Krillin, Koji, Bardock, Xireth, Boko, Braska, Zarkonion, Roan, and anyone else who helped refine the rules, lurve ya.

1 RPHELP RPTIPS ROLEPLAYS~
&B===============================================================================&C
This helpfile will help people better understand what can and cannot
be done in roleplays.  There are a lot of confusion about how much damage
one can do to the planet earth.  Most believe "oh you can't destroy
suchandsuch city" Well people you gotta realize this is Dragon
Ball/DBZ/DBGT There is going to be planet damage.  You can expect a 100bil
base character to not be able to destory a city.  Of course this is for the
evil people who want to destroy and conquer planets.  But for good guys you
can use the Dragon Balls to wish back planets/cities/people and more, which
will be talked about later

Some guidelines people should follow while roleplaying;
&G
 &G*Destroying planets/cities; You may destroy cities that are on planet earth
  but in the case that you do you most one, post a note on the roleplay board
  with the name of the city/planet you destroyed, so that people who survived
  are able to wish others back with use of other Planets dragon balls

 *Wishes; Wishes are allowed, though they can not meet certain extreme's such as
  You cannot wish for more then a 5% powerlevel increase, this will only affect
  in roleplay powerlevel, and will not go up as your in game PL increases for example
  if you are at 100 pl and wish for a 5% pl gain you would go from 100 to 105, but
  When you get to 5000, your pl would not increase by 5%, so its only a temporary
  increase

 *God Roleplaying; Do not do this, an example of God RPing would be if you forced
  another player to do something. For example if Goku had thrown a punch at Bardock
  and Bardock decided to dodge the attack and grab Goku's arm. That would be
  unacceptable. He could lunge forward and attempt to grab it, unless you ask the
  other player for permission.

&CDragon ball Saga, is held shortly after the end of the Dragon Ball Z saga, about 3
to 5 years after the end of DBZ. Immortals were formed after long training in the
afterlife, Eventually their power came so huge that they obtained immortality. They
rule over the Universe, and the several planets. There power is undescripable but
they have limits and are not allowed to kill mortals.

These guidelines are subjected to changes and could be changed at any time, so keep
a check up on this helpfile, among the other one's you should, Have fun roleplaying
Any idea's you have you can either gnote to us (when they are up) Or email me, at
Ben_waff@hotmail.com
~

0 RPP~
&B==========================================================================
&C"Role-Playing Points" (RPP) can be gained via Good RP and encouraging
others to take place and involving them in your RP.  RPP is usually
awarded by multiples of 5.  RPP points are given by the discretion of the
immortal, some immortals give out points easier than others.  If you RPed
and are frustrated that you did not receive any points post a log of the
RP and we may credit you with the points you should have received.  RPP
points can also be gained by immortal run quests or contests.  The awards
for them are never set either and they vary from immortal to immortal.

When cashing in RPP points for prizes, if you get a custom item, it must
stay on the character than received the prize.  You may not trade off your
points to someone else.  Trying to gain RPP points for the same RP twice
will automatically result in a loss of 1/2 your RP points.  RPP is stored
as glory and can be viewed in score or worth.

52 RPPEDIT~
Syntax: rppedit (victim) +/-(5 or 10)

Slight confusing, so I'll elaborate.  First, you must be in the same room
as you target, just to make sure you didn't typo.  Second, you can only
increase or decrease in units of 5 or 10.  If you want to do more, just do
it repeatedly.  Below are examples.

rppedit victim +5 -- adds 5 RPPs to 'victim'

rppedit victim -10 -- takes 10 RPPs from 'victim'

You can also view how many RPPs someone has by simply typing the following:
rppedit (victim)

One final note.  If you have to remove RPPs from someone, whether for
punishment or they traded them in, please post on the admin board.

0 RPRULES~
&B====================================================================
&wDue to popular complaint, Role-playing rules have now been put into a
helpfile. Not all rules are listed here, but those that are obvious shall.

1. Your not Invincible, you cannot survive/dodge/counter/block
   absorb every attack thrown at you. RP Realistically
2. You cannot have weapons unless authorized by Administration.
3. Do -Not- blow up cities and/or Landmarks that would result in changes
   to the world itself as a whole or part. Minor destruction is enough
   to get people's attention.
4. Refrain from 'god-rping'. Similar to rule number 1, but more vague.
5. Don't use 'Mythical-Magical-Powerlevel/Techlevel Enhancing *stuff*'
   that would cause you to become godly powerful, such as a 'Virus' or 'Soul'.
   Keep it in the realm of DB/DBZ/DBGT at all costs please.

Finally, the most important rule of all...
6. Have fun.

Failure to comply with the request of the administration, and rules stated
above will result in either a prompt removal of your 'Roleplaying' ability,
or a short term silence, based upon the administration's discretion.

0 RPTIMELINE~
&B===========================================================================
&w
Roleplaying. Everyone does it. There has been a bit of confusion about the
timeline of the game in general roleplaying wise. This helpfile is made
to set that straight so people can have a better idea of what's going on.

It's a long, long time after the events of GT. All races have begun to
florish and prosper. Saiyans and halfbloods rarely get along, due to the
'lineage' and 'weak' blood. Humans are striving to keep alive by dwindling
numbers, and Icers have taken it upon themselves to create a new Freezar.

Humans continue to produce machines and Android lookalikes, still bent
on waging wars that are used without firearms, and the operation of 'drones'.
Bio-androids are becoming more plentiful, gathering in numbers behind
the scenes, ever steadily rising to power. There is an 'unclaimed'
government, but no one seems to mind. Order remains.

Briefly, fighting happens nearly everywhere. "Police" are Androids and
specialy trained force members from different races, set to hold situations.
Peace happens in small spurts, just like fighting. Usually there are compromises.

King Yemma and the Afterlife remain. In-Game areas are unaltered, and able
to be used to roleplay as you please. Keep in mind, death is usually permanant.

Any questions can be referred to RolePlaying Admins or otherwise.

~

1 RULES~
&B==========================================================================&C
There are new rules in place as of the previous player wipe.  If you can't
follow them, leave.  Hopefully the new rules will create a more relaxed
environment at some points.  Be warned that rule breaking will usually be
punished severely.

Public Etiquette:
  Most of the filtered words have been removed from the list of censored
  words.  This does NOT give you permission to go around cursing like a 
  bloody, drunken pirate.  Swearing excessively may get you warned or 
  silenced for a short amount of time, e.g., 5-15 minutes.  While this is
  for a good part up to the admin that are online, the punishment is 
  minute.

  For now, racial slurs are also off of the filter; however, racism will 
  not be tolerated at all.  One slur will result in deletion.  Period.
  The biggest change on this topic is probably concerning bashing.  We all
  know that there are people that just NEED to be bashed.  If you can bash
  someone without breaking other rules, you're good to go, AS LONG AS YOU
  AREN'T CONSTANTLY HOUNDING THEM.  If you are asked to stop by an admin,
  stop immediately, or face a silence of up to 8 hours.  Also keep in mind
  that it's not usually a good idea to bash an admin.

  }RDO NOT USE ANY WORD THAT IS A RACIAL SLUR, DON'T GIVE A SHIT IF IT'S
  NOT INTENDED TO BE RACIST.}x&C
&D&C
  Meaningless bullshit intended to insult someone can also be considered
  harassment.  If you're going to be an ass, be a good ass, not a dumb one.
  Spamming anything is a removal of privileges for 8 hours, possibly longer
  if on the boards.

  If you're being a bloody perv and someone wants you to stop on a public
  channel, stop.

Botting:
  Deleted.  Help trigger.

Bug Abuse:
  Range of punishment up to deletion.  If you find a bug, you damn well 
  better report it on the Bug board.

Multiplaying:
  Having more than one of your characters on at a time will result in 
  deletion of all of them online.

Character trading/donating:
  Don't do it.  If you're going to leave DBS, delete.  If you're going to 
  cry because your mommy grounded you for getting bad grades, delete.  If 
  we see traded characters floating around, delete.

Scamming:
  If there is no imm present for a trade, you're fucked.

Link-Dead Abuse:
  If you try to get out of something (like a PK, whatever), it's considered
  link-dead abuse, and you'll be helled for up to one week.

Ban Evasion:
  Deletion of characters.

Punishment Evasion:
  If you get silenced and log on to another character to bitch some more,
  get ready to be deleted.  Your punishment SHOULD be posted on the board.
  There is no such thing as evading a hell unless you somehow teleport out.

Alt. Revenge:
  As long as someone else isn't on your alt, if you can get them somehow,
  good job.  No leaving link-dead characters to spring into action, unless
  you want to be deleted.  If you're switching between your characters,
  USE THE QUIT COMMAND.

Muling:
  Better have a good friend that won't steal all your equipment.  If you
  have two alts on at once to mule, deletion.

Punishments should be posted on the Punish board.

Punishments should be recorded on the offender's comment log.

If you have a problem with a punishment, write a note to an imm that's 
higher than them.&D

0 SACRED "THE SACRED ORDER" SACREDORDER~
&B==============================================================================&C
Long ago in Earth's history, during a period of great turmoil and
uncertainty, a mysterious individual appeared upon the planet seeking those
of power and virtue.  He was known only as the Endless.  The warriors whom
he chose, six in all, were called to assist in the supreme task of
protecting the earth and its people.  To prove them worthy, the Endless set
forth a challenge in the form of one of Earth's greatest champions.  None
emerged either victor or loser, for the battle represented a test not of
strength or skill, but of heart, for those destined to be the planet's
chosen protectors.  Each went his separate way, but over time those
compelled by the Endless's call sought that their original fellowship might
flourish into a solid, new cause.  Out of this zeal arose the Sacred
Order.

The Sacred Order of Holy Knights, thus dubbed by Rizion, is a knighthood of
Earth's noblest fighters.  Their mission is threefold: to uphold good,
defend the innocent, and oppose evil.  Diverse in powers, backgrounds, and
personalities, the knights of the Sacred Order share the conviction that
only great good can overcome great evil, just as light erases darkness.
Not all members possess identical degrees of might and ability, but each
and all are upheld by the providential hand of the Endless and their
dedication to his calling, to preserve truth and justice on the earth.
knight, manifesting itself in times of crisis or unity.

Knights of the Sacred Order live by standards characteristic of knighthood.
Their code is honor, bravery, and chivalry.  Personal pride and arrogance
must give way to fellowship and accord among knights as they work together
against the forces of evil.  The Order does not view these as regulations,
but rather virtues to be cultivated in the heart and mind of each member.
However, disregarding these ideals of behavior will bring consequences.

In-game and Roleplay: The Sacred Order is not intended to be a pk or
war-based group.  Our grander goal is to provide an in-game foundation for
roleplay related to the Order and its members.  Warring against other clans
in-game will be quite rare, if it ever happens.  After all, knights of the
Sacred Order are called to be peacekeepers, not bloodthirsty killers.

All members are considered equal in the sense that they all share the same
identity of knighthood.  Nevertheless, certain responsibilities make
degrees of leadership a necessity within the Sacred Order.  As knights
strive valiantly for the side of good, they will receive greater and
greater rewards for service. These may come in the form of new items,
training in special techniques, or appointment to a status of lordship
within the Order.

0 SACRED2~
&B==========================================================================&C

-----------------------------MEMBERSHIP-----------------------------
To join the Sacred Order, a fighter must meet several important
requirements.

-- First, you must have a powerlevel of at least 700 million. This is to
ensure a high degree of combat skill among members.

-- Second, you must possess a bio which has been authorized. (See 'help
bio' for more information.)

-- Third, and most importantly, you must display a commitment to the
Order's principles. This is not to be undertaken lightly. Having a good
alignment is essential, but much more is involved in becoming a
sacred knight than mere wishfulness. In cases where candidates'
motives are unclear or their alignment wavers, the Order may require
that they prove themselves worthy in some way, whether in-game or
in roleplay.

Once deemed worthy, a fighter receives the accolade of knighthood
from one of the Sacred Order's leaders. Upon a newly fledged knight
will also be bestowed the token of membership, the Sacred Crest. A
gift from the Endless, this ethereal insignia bears an image unique to
each sacred knight, manifesting itself in times of crisis or unity.

0 SAIYA-JIN_EMPIRE SAIYA-JINEMPIRE SAIYAJINEMPIRE SAIYANEMPIRE SJE~
&B==================================================================&C
The Saiya-jin Empire is a reconstruction of the old Empire lead by King
Vegeta, with some changes.  Founded by several Saiyan radicals, the clan
is currently under the leadership of Seph.  Only those of Saiyan
blood may join the Empire, and they must prove themselves to be a
powerful Saiyan or Halfbreed. Unlike the Empire run by King Vegeta
during the time of Freezer, this empire protects the weak.  Gone are the
evil, planet purging warriors of the past.  Under their new leadership,
the Saiyans are now a united force for good in the universe.

Warriors are classified as being either 3rd, 2nd, 1st, or Elite class
Saiya-jin Warriors, with the higher ranks being bestowed upon those
who prove themselves worthy.  Powerlevel does matter to a point, but a
higher class Warrior is in command of any lower classes, no matter
their powerlevels.

This Empire is for good and neutral characters.
Saiyans must have a base powerlevel of at least 100 million to join,
and Halfbreeds must have a base of 200 million, to prove that their
weak Human sides have not corrupted them.

-1 SAIYAN SAIYANS SAIYA-JIN SAIYA-JINS SAIYANINFO~
&B==========================================================================&C
A brutal, primitive people, the Saiya-jins were a race of bandits on
Planet Plant. Their long-time rivals, the Tsufuru-jin, managed to keep
the physically strong race in check with their technology. However, the
Saiya-jins took over the planet when Plant had its first full moon in a
very long time. The planet was renamed Vegeta, and the Saiya-jins adopted
Tsufuru-jin machines for themselves. Ignorance brought the downfall of
their race when they refused to heed Bardock's warning about Freezer.
Their homeworld was smashed to bits, and only a handful of Saiya-jins
survived. All members of their race (even halfbreeds) possess the
ability to become an Oozaru, though few reach the level of Super Saiyan.

0 SAVE~
&B=================================================================================&C
SAVE saves your character and its inventory.  The system automatically saves
approximately one character every minute, but with the high number of players
usually online it may take hours before your own is auto-saved.  For this
reason, you should not rely on auto-save to keep your character updated.

Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.

Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.  You cannot SAVE and QUIT
with objects of a higher level than your own, as they will vanish when
you log out.  Every character is auto-saved at reboot.

Once you have put on a scouter, you can use the 'scan' command.  This
lets you check the powerlevel of mobs and players.  If you scan a person,
it will read off the powerlevel or explode.  Certain scouters have a max
PL they can scan up to, which is why there are different grades of scouters.
You can also scan in a certain direction to see the powerlevl of mobs or
characters in that direction.

Icers seem to be a very creative race.  At least, when creating ways
to kill others.  Scattered Finger Beam is simply a stunningly quick
barrage of tiny finger beams, staggering the victim back under their
force, if not killing them outright.

Each finger beam costs 100 energy, and 12 focus for each group of
ten quick finger beams.

Scatter shot launches a barrage of energy balls at your victim.  This is a
very chaotic attack, and has a tendancy to use up large amounts of energy.
You choose how many energy balls you wish to fire, between one and fifty,
and then type 'scatter #' to fire off the number you selected.  The amount
of energy drained is affected directly by how many energy balls are shot.

extra attack because of their long, prehensile tails.

0 SELFDESTRUCT SELF DESTRUCT~
&B===============================================================================&C
The great equalizer.  All of Dr. Gero's Androids are built with an extremely
powerful explosive inside of them, just in case.  Usable only in extreme
situations, the bomb lies dormant until certain conditions are met, and no
choices are left.  Gaining combat data from fallen enemies of higher
powerlevel will advance you towards being able to active the device.  This
suicidal tactic uses up 5000 energy and will take out anyone.  No questions
asked.  Of course the Android does wind up dead as well...

This move costs 100 self destruct charges to use.
~

0 SENSE~
&B==========================================================================&C
Syntax: sense <victim>

Sense, like it's name suggests, allows you to sense the power level of
another person.  Sense isn't as accurate as a scouter is, but your head
won't explode like a scouter does.

Sense works by telling you how much weaker or stronger another person
is compared to your own power level.  You may use sense on anyone, no
mater how much stronger or weaker they are compared to yourself.
~

0 SETAGE AGE~
&B==========================================================================&C
Syntax: setage <age>

Your age represents how old your character is.  You may change your age at
any time, since age is only used as a role playing aid.

The valid age ranges are 4 - 150.

57 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

&R=======================================================================
&wThe infamous "Super Kamikaze Ghost Attack". This odd technique was
created by the fused being 'Gotenks', while he trained in the HBTC before
facing Majin Buu there. Charging energy into his own body, he transformed
his ki into ghost copies of himself, that were essentially living bombs.
With this technique a halfbreed-halfbreed fused character can create
between 1 and 20 ghost copies of themselves, and send them flying into
their opponent, usually causing considerable damage. Each ghost takes
1000 energy to create, and 4 focus. This skill has a pl req of 100bil.

Those responsibilities are your priority, not training.  We ask that
you please train in your free time.

If one (1) week has passed and you have not been attending to your
responsibilities with out a good reason, you will be asked to read
this file and warned that if you continue slacking, you will be
demoted to a position with less responsibility.

If two (2) weeks have passed with continued slacking, you will be
demoted to a position with less responsibility.  The demotion
scale is as follows:
&WHead Builder -> Builder _-> Regular Player

0 SN SUPERNAMEK SNAMEK SUPER_NAMEK~
&B=======================================================================&C
An old race, with a pround tradition of fine warriors, the Nameks have
passed down their wisdom through the generations.  When a Namekian
reaches a certain powerlevel, they are able to receive the first blessing
of their ancestors' knowledge.  They become Super Nameks, with the
ability to raise their powerlevel by many times.  At first they can not
comprehend the full knowledge that has been left for them, but over time
-as they gain more powerlevel- they are able to increase their power
manyfold.

Super Namek goes from 1-26 times modification, although you start out with
a max of five.  You simply type 'super #' to tranform into a Super Namek
with that many times your base powerlevel.

The power requirement for each SN level listed here is but an approximation.
While it is not entirely 100% accurate, it is relatively close.  Kudos to
Triangle for making the chart.

0 SOLARFLARE 'SOLAR FLARE'~
&B=======================================================================&C
Solar Flare is performed by gathering energy and releasing it
in one wide, weak burst of light, instead of the usual compact,
concentrated beams seen in most ki attacks.

This move will blind your opponent, and anyone in the area who
doesn't know when to look away or close their eyes at the proper
moment.  It costs 20 focus and 1000 energy.

1 SPACE SHIP SHIPS PILOTING FLIGHT SPACECRAFT~
&B==========================================================================&C
The following commands are used to control spacecraft in DragonBall Saga:

SHIPS                   Shows list of ships that are for sale or rent.
BOARD <shipname>        Enters a ship.
LEAVESHIP               Leaves a ship.
LAUNCH                  Launches a ship .. make sure you wait till finished
                        before doing anything else.
LAND <location>         Lands at specified dock.
SPEED <newspeed>        Accelerates to specified speed.
COURSE <x y z>          Stears ship towards vector x y z.
STATUS                  Shows ships status.
INFO <ship>             Gives info on a ship.
RADAR                   Scans the surrounding system.
LIGHTSPEED              Preforms hyperspce jump to system set with calculate.
CALCULATE <system>      Calculates hyperspace jump to system.
BUYSHIP                 Used to purchas a ship.
SELLSHIP                Sells the ship to the local shipyard.
SHIELDS [ON|OFF|IDLE]   Turns shields on or off (idle leaves shields on but
                        they do not recharge and eventually drain away).
RECHARGE                Recharges shields faster.
OPENHATCH <ship>        Opens ships hatch.
CLOSEHATCH <ship>       Closes ships hatch.
TARGET <ship>           Aims weapons or turret at specified target.
FIRE [missile|rocket|torpedo] Fires lasers or specified missile.
REPAIRSHIP [shipsystem] Preforms repairs to ships hull or specified system.
ADDPILOT <name>         Allows a character to pilot your ship.
REMPILOT <name>         Removes a character from your ships pilot list.
AUTOTRACK Automaticly adjusts you course to follow your target.
CLANBUYSHIP Buys a ship for your organization.

SCHEDULE       Show's you where the Home World Transport ship is and where
               it is heading.
CALLSHIP Recalls your ship to your current location
~

1 SPACEPODTEST~
This is a test of DBS's space travel system.  5 space ships will be sold so
that they can be tested out.  This test doesn't involve the weapon systems
so these ships have no weapons on board.  The ships that are purchased
become your ships, you can do what every you want with them.  You can sell
them or crash them, I really don't care :)  but no reimbursements will be
given for lost ships/items/pl/zeni or what ever else you might lose due to
using the space ships unless it is due to a bug. All I ask is that if you
see any weird bugs or "oddities" to write a personal gnote to me (Goku).
Also if you think I should make anything more clear or readable like
readouts/displays/messages or anything else you think i should change I'd
like you to also write me about.

The 5 ships will be auctioned off over the auction channel with a starting
bid of 10,000 zeni (their normal price is 500k zeni). I will be selling
"proofs of purchase" that can be traded in (to me, Goku) and I will
transfer ownership of the spaceship to you.  Normally ships can not be sold
like this, they are more like buying and selling stuff at a store they
can't be auctioned.

If you buy a ship you can learn how to use it by typing "help space"

The space ship system has been ported from SWR to DBS so if you have
experience flying ships in SWR based MUDs you should be good to go.  Even
without SWR experience, you should be able to use the ships without to much
of a problem :)  I figured it out and I've never played a SWR MUD :)
~

0 SPAM~
&B===============================================================================&C
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command

It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.

Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded,
non-store room is considered spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive
or irritating screen scroll can be considered spam.

0 SPARRING SPARING SPAR STOPSPAR~
&B==========================================================================&C
Syntax: spar <player>
        stopspar

To spar with a friendly player only need to use the spar command.
While in sparing mode, you will not kill your training partner. You
will only fight until he or she is unconscious then you will stop the
combat.

You can only spar some one who is the same alignment as your self.
Hardcore characters, of course, are the exception to this rule.

To end a spar just type 'stopspar' you will then stop sparing with
your partener.

spec_fido                Mobile eats corpses.
spec_janitor             Mobile picks up trash.

spec_poison              Mobile poisons during battle.
spec_thief               Mobile steals gold from players.

0 SPECIALBEAMCANNON SBC~
&B========================================================================&C
The Mankankousappou means something like Devil's Penetrating
Energy Blast, but is better known to us as the Special Beam Cannon.
This attack was created by Piccolo to kill Goku, and did accomplish
its goal.  Only Nameks may learn this move, which is one of
their most effective.  It costs 350 energy and 13 focus to fire this
deadly corkscrew beam.

# decrease component's value[1], and extract if it reaches 0
$ decrease component's value[2], and extract if it reaches 0
% decrease component's value[3], and extract if it reaches 0
decrease component's value[4], and extract if it reaches 0
decrease component's value[5], and extract if it reaches 0
and ! will make the spell fail if the caster is carrying that component.

Example: V1100 V+1101
The spell will only succeed if the caster is carrying objects of vnums
1100 and 1101.  The object of vnum 1100 will get consumed by the spell,
and the object of vnum 1101 will not.

With the decremental operators (@#$%), the object must have at least
a value of 1 in the respective location for the spell to succeed.

0 SPIRITBALL SB~
&B=========================================================================&C
Yamcha perfected the usage of hand gestures and energy control to
guide his ki blasts through the air.  The Sokidan is the culmination of
many years of effort, an extremely powerful explosion contained
within a tiny, manueverable ball of white light.  Spirit Ball takes 22
focus and 800 energy to perform.
~

0 SPIRITBOMB GENKIDAMA~
&B======================================================================&C
The Genki Dama is arguably the most powerful attack ever used in
Dragonball Z.  Some might say the Dragon Fist surpasses its
power in Dragonball GT, but the Spirit Bomb seems much more
useful.  Indeed, this move finishes almost all Dragonball villians.
The user draws in power from everything around them...plants,
animals, inanimate objects, people, the planets and stars
themselves...

On the Dragonball Saga MUD, Spirit Bomb is a Saiyan-only
attack.  It requires 2,500 energy and anywhere from 1-100 focus.
You type 'spirit #', and it will cost the amount of focus you type in
(from 1-99, max for 100) and do increasing amounts of damage.
Also, energy will be leeched from mobs and players nearby you to
increase the amount of damage dealt.

1 SPLITFORM SPLIT-FORM~
&B===============================================================================&C
Syntax : split-form

The split form technique is a very powerful and very useful ability.
When used it creates a double of the user who is just about as strong
and skilled as the original.  The double will follow the user, fight
with the user and mimic any skills or abilities used in combat.

If the split form technique is executed incorrectly a double will
still most likely be created, however this failed double will not be
as powerful as one created by doing this technique correctly.

Even with an ability as strong as split form, there are still some
limitations.  Since these doubles are not "true" living beings, their
life force isn't as great as a normal person (20 instead of 100). The
doubles ki energy comes mostly from the user when it is created (half
of your energy is channeled into the double to give it life). Doubles
also can not power up because it would drain to much energy from
their bodies to do so.  The user must be at the power level he or she
wishes their double to have when using the split form technique.

Note: To interact specificaly with the double use the name
'split<name>'.  So Piccolo's double would be 'splitPiccolo'.  It is
one word to prevent tells and other actions going to the double instead
of the player.

0 SSDBOMBER SSD BOMBER~
&B==================================================================================
&CThe SSD Bomber or "Special Skill Deadly Bomber" is an attack used by
the revered Android 13 in "The Three Super Saiya-Jin" or Movie 7.
It is an advanced form of attack that uses the most advanced technology
to date. Compressing a normal ball of energy to tremendous proportions,
the user can encompass the ball with a magnetic field that chases after
it's target, leaving little to no room for escape from such an advanced
technique.

The Attack uses 40 Focus and 5,000 energy to charge through the androids
form just to compress such tremendous power. It can be one of the most
deadly attacks if used right...

0 SSJ SSJ2 SSJ3 SSJ4 SUPER_SAIYAN~
&B==========================================================================&C
Saiyans and halfbreeds can turn into Super Saiyans.  Since a Halfbreed
isn't a full blooded Saiyan they cannot go beyond Super Saiyan Level 3.
The powerlevel modifiers for turning into a Super Saiyan are as follows:

 &Y-&W Super Saiyan 1 &Cx &R10&c  +8 str,  +5 spd, +3 int,  +5 con
 &Y-&W Super Saiyan 2 &Cx &R16&c +16 str,  +8 spd, +4 int,  +8 con
 &Y-&W Super Saiyan 3 &Cx &R24&c +24 str, +12 spd, +6 int, +12 con
 &Y-&W Super Saiyan 4 &Cx &R30&c +30 str, +15 spd, +8 int, +15 con

&CNormally Super Saiyans find it easiest to gradually power up through the
multiple stages of their transformations.  However, by expending extra
energy they can switch between different forms without going
through every other stage.  Each stage skipped adds half the energy
needed to use the chosen form to the final cost.

0 STORAGE BASEMENT ANDROIDSTORAGE ANCIENTLABBASEMENT~
&B============================================================================&C
This hidden area is part of a quest designed solely for Androids.  It is
different from all the other areas in DBS.  It will be assumed you
have read this helpfile before entering.  Several rules and helpful
guidelines will be given.

&W1.  Once you enter, you CANNOT leave until you finish the quest.
2.  There are no mobs that you can conveniently gain Techlevel off of.
3.  The western path requires a max TL of around 10 billion.
3.  The eastern path requires a max TL of around 125 billion.
4.  A sizable amount of zeni is required to complete the quest.  Don't
enter if you're poor.
5.  If you get stuck inside, you're stuck inside.  Healing tanks and
arena rooms have been added in case you are locked inside for long
amounts of time.  You will not be transferred out.
6.  You won't be given hints.  You are not allowed to talk about this
quest on any channel, including FOS.  Don't lead people through
this quest.  Selling/giving away items you find is the only way someone
who can't finish the quest will get them.
7.  Do not sell any of the non-reward items, or in any way take them out
of the area.  You will understand when you enter the area.  That means,
do not put any of the items into any container.  Leave them in your inventory.
8.  If you are an asshole in this area, or do anything else stupid not
covered in this helpfile, prepare to be punished.
9.  There's a bug in how some numbers show up after about 2.1 billion.
The TL needed to wear the item that shows up bugged is 5 billion.&D

&CLastly, since my(Viola) name will pop up if you check this area,
I will go ahead and say that a lot of the other Imms helped with this.
Even if a few had no idea what they were writing descriptions for, or
why they were researching some obscure part of Dragonball.  So
all you players thank Koronto, Krillin, and Bardock for helping get
this area built.&D

0 STYLE STYLES~
&B===========================================================================&C
Styles are used by typing style and then the name of the style you wish.
Styles, when effectively used, can change the tide of battle. The more
experienced one is in a particular style, the better the chances that it
will work for the fighter's advantage. There are five different known
styles. Styles can be changed within combat to better ones advantage
and knowledge of each of the different forms of combat.

1 SUPERANDROID "SUPER ANDROID"~
&R=======================================================================
&wIt has long been assumed that Biomechanical Androids were the true
ultimate android creations of Dr Gero. However, this is not the case.
By creating his normal androids incomplete in certain respects, he made
them capable of fusing their bodies together; by which they could
transform into a being of imposing power.

In order to become a super android, an android must collect the CPU and
Power Core of two other androids that are over 300bil pl. In addition to
this, the other android cores must be of a different type than its own.
Ie, if the android is a type FM, it must absorb a type H and a type E
into itself. Etc etc. In the process, the two other androids will
permanently lose their characters. Once the android absorbs these parts
into itself, it can then connect them to its primary systems and
transform.

Because the transformation draws its powers from internally absorbed
parts, it does not require a techlevel chip to work; nor is it compatible
with them. You cannot wear a chip while transformed, nor can you transform
while wearing a chip. Super android is a x25 techlevel modifier, that
gives +25 to all stats, and costs 20000 energy to use.

Super Androids gain the techniques and abilities of all 3 android
types.

0 SUPPRESS~
&B=========================================================================&C
Powerful fighters can use this skill to lower their current powerlevel
to below their base powerlevel.  This trick is useful for fighting weaker
opponents, or tricking foes into underestimating you.

To select the level you wish to suppress to, use suppress <powerlevel>.
To suppress to that powerlevel, use suppress with no arguments.  You can
change your suppress level any time at will.  Every time you attempt
to suppress your power you will expend fifty energy.
~

0 SWEAR~
&B==========================================================================&C
We do allow swearing on public channels to a certain degree.  You
must abide by the following rules if you wish to swear on public
channels:

&W1)&C Do not make any discriminating racial or sexual comments.

&W2)&C Do not swear at administrators.  Doing so is a punishable
     offence.

&W3)&C The following are 'swear' words allowed on public channels:
      Ass, bastard, bitch, shit, and damn.

&W4)&C If a player tells you to stop swearing, do so immediately.
     Even if what you are saying is on the acceptable 'swear'
     list.  If you continue swearing after they ask you to stop
     that is considered harassment, and you will be punished
     accordingly.

&W5)&C Please do not "bypass the filter".  Bypassing the filter is
     defined as doing things that allow you to use a swear word on
     a channel without it being caught by the filter code.  An
     example would be as follows: say the word "blarg" was a swear
     word.  If you typed "b l a r g" you could be considered
     bypassing the filter.  Blocking out half of the letters, or
     more, does NOT count as bypassing the filter.  For example,
     typing "!@#$%^ you" would NOT be considered bypassing the
     filter.

Bypassing the filter is punishable with 10 minutes to 8 hours of
silence, depending on severity and how many times you've been
punished for bypassing the filter in the past.

52 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
Syntax: return

SWITCH switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC).

RETURN returns you to your original body.
~

0 TAG ELIMINATIONTAG ET~
&B===========================================================================&w
Tag, or Elimination Tag, is a small quest head off and on by immortals. It
will be held when an immortal feels fit to play it, and it will not be
played if asked. (Most of the time &B;)&w)

Upon an immortal's announcement that tag will be hosted, you are to say

tag over the quest channel if you wish to play. You will then be transferred
to the specialy built arena.

The object of the game, is to not be the person to be tagged at the end of
each round. To tag someone, type &Btag <person>&w. After than, run as fast
as you can throughout the arena, and try and avoid being tagged. The host will
then announce the end of the round, and whoever is it will be eliminated. If
you are it at the end of the round, then you are too report to the host and
tag them. You will then be escorted out of the arena.

This will keep going until we have only a single person remaining. We may
choose to add various twists to the game to make it more interesting, and
these changes will be announced at the start of the game.
&B===========================================================================
~

0 TAIL TAILS~
&B==========================================================================&C
Halbreeds and Saiyans are both born with monkey tails.  This is the
source of their power, but also what changes them into the fearsome
beast known as an Oozaru.  You can pull your tail off yourself, to
prevent this transformation, with the 'pull tail' command.  Also, in
battle your tail might be at risk...

0 TAPION~
&RBackground :&x
&CTapion, known as the Divine Entity, came to assist Goku in saving the
planet Earth. While there, a young HalfBreed Warrior named Trunks, who
is the son of Vegeta and Bulma, trained under him. After the training,
he bequeathed his sword, the Legendary "Z Saber", unto Trunks, and
disappeared. Now.. he has returned, years later, with a new purpose.
In the absence of Goku, he is taking up the role of training warriors
who wish to protect Planet Earth. He cannot intervene himself, for he
is now one of the Immortal Beings of the Galaxy.&x

&RMy Role on Saga :&x

&CMy role on Saga is simple. I'm an Enforcer. Meaning, for those who
lack literal skills, I Enforce the rules on this MUD. You break the
rules, I break you. I deal with standard affairs--silencing, helling--
Now, though... I have taken up another task... I am now a Builder here
as well. I'm pretty laid back, I guess... though people only know my
strict side. I'll make it simple, people. Follow the rules, and I'll
be your best friend. Break them, I'll be the biggest... ignorant jerk
you know.&x

1 TEACHMYSTIC~
&R=======================================================================
&wThis is the command you use if you want to teach mystic to someone else.
Only the Grand Kaioshin or Supreme Kaioshin may use this command (no, not
the imm kaioshins). In order to teach someone mystic, you must already
know the technique yourself, the person you want to teach it to must be
over 100bil pl, and you must both be in a safe room. They must also not
be a race that cannot use mystic (ie, icer, android, bio-android).
Once these requirements have been met, type &Rteachmystic (name)&w to
begin the process. Teaching someone mystic takes &R30 minutes&w to
complete. During that time, neither you, nor the person being taught
mystic can type &Ranything&w. Otherwise, the process will fail, and you
will both have to start over from the beginning.

Have fun. :P

0 THE_PANEL~
&B==========================================================================
&wThe Panel of Dragonball Saga consists of The Enforcement Team alone.
Any questions, comments, things to say that are relevant and not exploding
anger fits shall be listened to accordingly. The word of the Enforcement
team is final. Thank you, and Good Luck.

56 THINK~
There is *no* "la la la"ing on think.
~

0 TICK~
&B============================================================================&C
Many of the actions in DBS MUD are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, and hp/energy regeneration.

Of these timers, the hp/energy regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this MUD average 60 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.

~

0 TIMECHAMBER 'TIME CHAMBER' HBTC~
&B==========================================================================&C
The Hyperbolic Time Chamber (also known as the Room of Spirit and Time) is a
place where time flows differently that the real world.  In this other
dimension the passage of time moves more swiftly than it does in the real
universe, allowing warriors to train at a greatly accelerated rate.

For game purposes, the Time Chamber is a combination Sparring Arena, Gravity
Training Room and Healing Tanks.  This means you can either spar with someone
or gravity train while getting increased health gains.  For sparring purposes
one can only fight with a designated &Wpartner&C.

Anyone who can spar or gravity train can use the Time Chamber with the
following restrictions placed upon its use:
  * It can only be used for 15 minutes at a time
  * Once the 15 minutes are up it can not be used for another 48 RL hours

51 TIMER~
Associated help files: help corpse, help imm cr, help bodybag

31 to 40                "is lying here."
23 to 30                "is buzzing with flies."
15 to 22                "fills the air with a foul stench."
07 to 14                "is crawling with vermin."
01 to 06                "is in the last stages of decay."

Since a corpse now lasts from 40 to 60 minutes, we are requested to wait
until the corpse has reached below a timer of 23 or has hit the
"fills the air with a foul stench." stage in decay.

You can see what stage of decay a corpse is in by either typing:
ostat <player name>       (i.e. ostat Brittany)    OR
at 'corpse <name>' look   (i.e. at 'corpse Brittany' look)
~

0 TITLE~
&B==============================================================================&C
Syntax:  title <string>

This command allows you to set your title the text of your choice.  The
game supplies a title when your character is created and each time you
advance a level.

You cannot set your title until you have a powerlevel of 5000.  You are not
allowed to use any obscene or offensive words/phrases in your titles.  Also,
do not mention any groups or fake 'clans'.  This takes away from the few
players who worked hard enough to get their own clan started.

1 TOKEN~
&B==================================================================================&C
Quest tokens are acquired by killing Super Saiya-jin 4 Vegeta.  You may be given
a token by the supervising imm, but it is far more likely Vegeta will load it.

Below is a list of possible prizes and the number of tokens required.  Note
that token prizes may be used as a gift for another player.  And also note
that quest tokens will not, under any circumstances be reimbursed, no
matter how you lose them.

5                                       8% increase in powerlevel **

10                                      20% increase in powerlevel **

* By 'item restrung' I mean this: you can transform any item into any thing
you want, but this desired item must be approved by a level 58 or above imm
to ensure it does not upset game balance.  And we cannot change object
programs--that's locked out by code.

** This will be rounded to the nearest digit of importance.
Example: 6,015,278,104 * 1.20 -> 7,200,000,000

*** This requires approval of the builder's area you wish to explore, and
your exploration will be supervised by a level 58 or above imm.  Should you
'ditch' them, you will be removed from the area.

**** Limited to one per player. We will be monitoring who has these, and if
we catch someone with more than they should have, ALL of that player's equipment
will be removed.

0 TRADE TRADING~
&B==========================================================================
&w
Trading. Something everyone likes to do. Benefiting both parties most times.
Other times, one ends up screwed. Yes, it has become apparent and thus this
was made. The rules for Trading go as follows:

 - You can trade items, zeni, equipment, and respect.
 - An Administrator can be present at the time. If not, at own risk.
 - Character trading isn't legal, and can't be condoned.
 - If you are scammed, and an administrator wasn't present, log it and
      send it in. Otherwise, you are out of luck.

0 TRAFFIC~
&B============================================================================&C
Syntax:  traffic <message>

Traffic is akin to the old auction channel, meaning it is a
simple channel on which to offer to buy or sell whatever it is
you wish to buy or sell.

Please do not spam other channels with offers to buy or sell
goods.  Use the traffic channel.

Traffic is for the exchange of equipment, not for discussion.

0 TRAIN~
&B==========================================================================&C
Attribute Trains are special points gained at certain powerlevels,
that allow you to increase your base attributes. You may spend points
wherever you wish, but you should carefully consider your choices, and
consult with other players before you do so.  Each character begins
with five (5) trains, and trains are gained in sets of five (5) as your
power level increases.

The formula to gain training points does not calculate the power level
requirement 'cleanly'.  There for you gain training points at very
weird power levels.  The approximate values for all of the trains have

There are a total of 72 training point sets to learn, including the set
you get when you first create.

If you were wondering, here is the formula used to calculate when you
get training point sets:
(&w(X^3.07) * 10,000&C) = PL Requirement
where X is what training point set you are expecting next.

&B==========================================================================
&RCongratulations!  You have achieved the '&GTranscendent Warrior&R' rank!&C

&CYour reward for reaching this incredible level is:

 * can use the 'restore all' command once every 12 hours

If your ranking drops below the Transcendant rank, you will lose this ability

0 TRANSFORMATIONS TF~
&B==========================================================================&C
On the Icer homeworld, only the strong survive.  They learn how to control
the power contained inside themselves, transforming their bodies slightly
and creating strange auras of extreme cold around themselves.  Some
think this might be because of the conditions on their home planet,
or that their bodies are like living deep freezers.  No matter how they
came about their mysterious powers, they become much more powerful when
they transform into one of their four later forms.

0 TRANSPORT~
&B=========================================================================&C
The Home World Transport Ship takes you between the Center of the
Universe and Earth.  You enter it by using the command 'board ship' and
leave it with 'leaveship'.  If you are wearing a scouter, you may then
use the 'schedule' command to check the status and location of the ship.
~

0 TRAPBALL~
&B=======================================================================&C
This is yet another dirty trick the Icers have come up with.  The
unfortunate opponent is trapped inside a ball of energy, and batted
around like a plaything by the Icer.  However, whenever the energy
ball touches anything but its creator, it explodes...

This costs 1000 energy and 25 focus to perform.
~

0 TRIBEAM TRI-BEAM~
&B=====================================================================&C
Created and perfected by Tien, this attack has since been copied
by many other human warriors.  However, usually only members of
his three-eyed racial subset can truly master it.  Proper balance in
energy must be maintained in each corner of the diamond created by
placing the thumbs and fingers of both hands against their partners.
Then the energy is collected and shot out in a blast that is more
powerful than its size suggests.  This is one of the best attacks
humans may learn, costing 2500 energy and 25 focus to use.
~

53 TRIGGER~
A trigger is an action, phrase, or game event that causes a program
held within a room, mob or object, to begin playing out its commands.

Triggers can be anything from a player or mob entering a room, to a
player stating a particular phrase within a room, or to a mob or an
object.

For detailed information on triggers, see:

RPTRIGGERS, MPTRIGGERS, OPTRIGGERS
~

60 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

50 UC UNITEDCOUNCIL~
&B============================================================================&C
The United Council, originally founded by the great Saiya-jin Soul, is
an oppressive force of evil, with its tendrils of infulence reaching
throughout the universe.  There are no racial barriers within this clan,
they don't care what you look like as long as you bring the right cards
to the table.  They accept anyone that is willing to follow their motto
of "Money, Power, and Organization" as well as their other, less ethical
principals.

Members of the United Council are led by Dramius, and spread terror through
space as they ravage each land they come upon, taking whatever bounty
they may find.  They are feared, powerful men and women, respected by
even their righteous enemies.  The higher a member's powerlevel, the
higher their rank inside the Council.

The United Council accepts members of all races, of evil alignment.
You must have a base powerlevel of at least 500 million to apply.
~

59 UNFOLDAREA~
Syntax:  unfoldarea <area filename>

This command will load up an area file.

NOTE:  It could be quite dangerous to unfold an area that is already
       loaded, or one that has not been tested.

~

0 UNOUTCAST~
&B=======================================================================&C
An outcast who has saved enough zeni to remove the flag simply types
'unoutcast'. The flag will be removed and the appropriate fee taken
from them (see help outcast for charge).

See Also:  &WOUTCAST&D
~

0 UPGRADE~
&B===============================================================================&C
Androids gain no benefit from training in higher gravity, since their
solid forms were already meant to withstand such forces.  Instead they
periodically are rewarded with hardware upgrades that can be installed
to raise their stats.  These are received at the same times as the
other races receive trains.
~

0 UPPERCUT~
&B==========================================================================&C
Performing an uppercut takes a bit of concentration and energy but has
results that can be quite devastating.  Whether it's performed by first
crouching and then springing up in an explosive attack or merely bringing
one's fist from about hip-level straight up this attack is something to
watch out for.

Uppercutting costs 25 energy and 4 focus.
~

54 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]

The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke

When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

54 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

0 USSJ USSJ2 ULTIMATESUPERSAIYAN~
&B=======================================================================&C
While in training, some Super Saiyans have discovered how to
ascend beyond their normal limits.  These Ultimate Super Saiyans
quickly discovered drawbacks to their techniques, however.
By concentrating large amounts of energy within their bodies, they
are able to increase their powerlevels and strength much higher
than any regular Super Saiyan could ever hope to acheive.
This improved strength also increases body mass, causing their
speed to lower considerably, making the 'perfected' version of
this technique not so perfect after all...

58 VASSIGN RASSIGN MASSIGN OASSIGN~
&B==========================================================================&C

Syntax: vassign <builder> <low_vnum> <hi_vnum>

 Steps for creating a new area from scratch;
 1. checkvnum rooms   low_vnum hi_vnum
    checkvnum objects low_vnum hi_vnum
    checkvnum mobs    low_vnum hi_vnum
     (make sure the vnums don't overlap another area)
 2. vassign <builder> <low_vnum> <hi_vnum>
 3. force <builder> savearea
 4. force <builder> save

This should create a new area listed as '{PROTO} (Person)'s area in
progress', with the file name '(person).are' and it should load up after
rebooting the MUD with 'loadarea' or 'loadarea (person).are' if it's not
your area.

You should always assign areas out in blocks of 100 vnums.  This gives
the new area space for additions later on, as well as makes everything
look pretty.  An example of what is ment by this is as follows:
vassign <builder> 2000 2099

NEVER do this to someone who has an area assigned to them. This would
change the range for the area they have assigned and wipe out the area.
~

0 VESANIA~
&B========================================================================&C
Vesania... not merely a clan, but a force of nature in and of
ourselves. Drawing our breath from the chaos and disorder
inherent in all of life's creations, Vesania seeks to reduce all
around us to a state of perfect disorder, perfect chaos. Neither
evil nor good, we exist in a constant state of indecision, taking
actions seemingly on a whim. We strike out against the bondage
and control forced by those who support order, using any
method neccesary to achieve our goals. These could be as large
as killing a highly recognized figure, or destroying entire cities, or
as small as tying someones shoelaces together in a crowd. We
seek a greater, perfect freedom, than either those who support good
or evil could ever hope to attain.  Chaos will be created wherever
we go.

Vesania's hierarchy is loosely constructed and informal, to put it
mildly. Due to our constant striving to free ourselves from the
bonds of order, we only keep together a few threads of
structure to allow ourselves to function. At our head is a
triumvirate council, responsible for keeping track of the clans,
and taking charge when some amount of organization is
required; The Furors. Beneath them are the Guardians, Furies,
Ravers, and lastly the footpads. Actual strength is not a factor
involved in ranking.

Requirements to join: We have no powerlevel requirement,
aside from that necessary to use channels. Additionally, we have
no race restrictions. As for alignment, well, at our hearts we are
neutral, though we are a bit flexible there, as beings of all beliefs
can help further our goals; Final loyalty must always be to the
perfect state of disorder we bring to the universe. Applicants
must demonstrate a near-fanatic enthusiasm for the freeing of
our universe from the bonds of order, and of course be
prepared to risk death, ridicule, and more for it. Even the
weakest character can be used as a tool for our ends, don't
count yourself out because you're only a Trained Fighter. A sense
of humour is also, most definitely, a must.

55 VNUMS~
Syntax: vnums [low] [high]

Lists the vnum range for rooms/mobs/objects in all prototype areas.
~

58 VSEARCH~
Syntax: Vsearch <vnum>

This command will list all instances of an object with that vnum that
are currently in the game.
~

0 WAR WARTALK~
&B============================================================================&C
Syntax:  war <message>

Wartalk is a channel created as a haven for those players who like to openly
discuss their exploits in combat - and brag against their opponents.  It is
most often used for those who declare war on other deadlies and is desirable
for those who like to invite others to battles in player versus player
whether it be in the arena or around DBS MUD.

Wartalk can be seen by all players in the game, and has the same
rules as other channels.  No harassment, profanity, spamming, or
inappropriate subject matter.

Syntax: warn race  <field>
Syntax: warn site  <field>

51 WATCH~
. &w
&W Syntax: &G watch                  &W Shows you a help screen
&W Syntax: &G watch size             &W Shows the size of your watch file
&W Syntax: &G watch clear            &W Deletes your watch file

&W Syntax: &G watch player <name>    &W Starts watching a player
&W Syntax: &G watch site <site>      &W Starts watching all players from site
&W Syntax: &G watch delete <number>  &W Stops a watch
&W Syntax: &G watch print 1          &W Shows file starting at line 1
&W Syntax: &G watch print 500        &W Shows file starting at line 500
&W Syntax: &G watch print 500 100    &W Shows 100 lines starting at line 500

Watch will work 24 hours a day from the time you put a watch on a player until
you take it off. You can also watch all players from a specific site.

We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 1000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

'Wimpy <value>' allows you to set your wimpy at a level you determine,
but it cannot exceed about 75% of your maximum hitpoints.
'Wimpy max' sets your wimpy at its maximum level for you.
Some monsters are wimpy.

1 WISH WISHES~
&R=======================================================================
&wThe following is a temporary listing of various things that can be
wished for using the dragonballs. It will be subject to further
editing in the future.

&GImmortality:
&wA higher, permanent form of preservation, basicly. It cuts all pl
losses down to 1%; even mob deaths.
However, if you are immortal, you become incapable of going to the afterlife.
&RAndroids cannot be granted immortality, sorry.

&GPower:
&wA 10% increase in powerlevel.

&GWealth:
&wA random amount of zeni, between 5 and 10 million.

&GItem:
&wCan get one of any item that exists in the game, that isn't restricted
to immortals only. (can't get runestone daggers, etc)

&GFame:
&wYou can have a stat in the records section of your pfile increased by a
random amount. Ie, pkills, mkills, sparwins, etc. You can also have
some of them reduced. Ie, pdeaths, mdeaths, sparlosses, etc.

&GMiscellaneous:
&wThis means you can try and wish for something not on this list. Whether
or not it will be granted is soley up to the discretion of the eternal
dragon. Getting turned down for a miscellaneous wish will not rob you
of your ability to be granted a wish.

Other wishes may eventually be added in the future.

&ROnce you make a wish, you may not make another wish for one month.&D

for, the following are parameters for its use:

 - Immortals level 51 through 54 should be visible at all times, save
   for when snooping, running a quest or some similar circumstance.

 - Immortals level 55 and up may invis to any level at their discretion.

Guidelines for use of wizinvis by 55 and higher:
It is considered mandatory to be visible to all other immortals whenever
reasonably able to do so.  Using wizinvis beyond 51 to facilitate work on
a project, allow concentration on something, avoid excessive tells or the
like is fine, but it should only be used while necessary.

Guidelines for use of wizinvis beyond 51 in immortal channels:
Sightings of Someones in immortal channels should be kept to a minimum.
If you are free enough to be able to use an immortal channel, you should
be visible to the lowest immortal in that channel; no higher than 54 in
Muse, no higher than 51 in immtalk, etc.  Being a Someone to anyone on
an immortal channel should only occur if you're too tied up to go
visible but need to make a comment.

The same applies to all situations using channels, tells or actions.
Avoid being a Someone to mortals and immortals alike unless you have
a good reason to do otherwise.

-1 WORTH~
&B===========================================================================&C
WORTH shows a simple, easy-to-read table of important and widely used
statistics. This command is for the character itself and cannot be used
on others. The Statistics that follow have been included in the table:
Level, Favor, Alignment, Experience, Glory, Weight, Style, and Gold.

This command isn't very well set up for the new DBS interface, but it is
still usable.

0 WRISTMOUNTED GUN BLASTER CANNON~
&B==========================================================================&C
At lower powerlevels, most fighters are unable to properly focus thier ki
into energy attacks.  Through technological advances, a way around this
restriction has been found.  Wrist-mounted blasters convert the energy not
yet usable by their owners into brillant blasts of light.  This is quite
helpful, but the items are quickly discarded and their use discouraged by
fighters with enough power to correctly perform energy attacks.

Use the 'zap' command to activate an energy gun.

1 WSS WEAPONSOULSEPPUKU "WEAPON SOUL SEPPUKU"~
&R=======================================================================
&wWeapon Soul Seppuku, aka Weapon Soul Suicide. A highly coveted fighting
technique among Demons. It is only taught to those who hold high Demon
ranks, and can only be performed by them. Charging a high amount of
energy into a Demon weapon they have created, the Demon launches their
weapon at their enemy, sometimes causing considerable damages, sometimes
missing altogether, and sometimes instantly killing their opponent. Using
this technique destroys the weapon, however. Because of this, compounded
with the fact that a Demon may only have 2 demon weapons in its
inventory, aside from the one it is wielding, this leaves a maximum total
of 3 times that this technique can be used in a fight. Weapon Soul
Seppuku has a powerlevel requirement of 10 billion, costs 2500 energy to
use, 1 demon weapon, and 25 focus.

(this skill is learned at 95% when practiced, by the way)

0 ZFIGHT "Z FIGHTERS" ZFIGHTERS~

The Z-Fighters, a group of legendary warriors dedicated to the
protection of peace and justice in the galaxy. For many years
they fought to protect everyone and everything from the evils
that would seek to destroy the peace in the universe. From
many races and backgrounds, these warriors banded together
for the purpose of achieving one common goal. Several
decades ago, the fighting ended, and a long span of peace and
prosperity spread througout the galaxies, and the Z-Fighters
went their own separate ways, feeling that they were no longer
needed.

In recent times however, evil has arisen in the universe, and
once again a group of noble protectors is needed. Goku himsef
has re-formed the Z-Fighters. People of all races have stepped
up to accept the great challenge set by Goku, and to protect
the rights and lives of all those who need it. His search for new
members continues, always searching for someone new to
defend peace and prosperity. Peace shall once more reign over
the universe.....

Clan Requirements:
In order to join the Z-Fighters, you must be of good alignment
and also have a powerlevel no less than 100 million. You must
have an authed bio.  Besides the basics, each leader may have
a different task or requirement.
