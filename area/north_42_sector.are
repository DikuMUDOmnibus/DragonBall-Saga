Dirt Road Into The Countryside~
To the south, this dirt road leads back into South City.  To the north,
however, it leads off into the hilly countryside.  A nice, quiet, scenic
hike never hurt anyone.  It's also good to venture down this path sometimes
since the going word is that there is some kind of fighting arena several
miles in this direction.  While walking is a good mode of transportation,
flying, if you can, would be a quicker way to get there instead.  It's up
to the traveler.

Bend In The Road~
Out in the countryside, this dirt road serves as the lifeline for many
of the farmers and their families living out in this rural area who
occasionally need to get supplies.  Although winding through the hills and
valleys, this road still goes in a general south-to-north direction.  Not
much of interest though along this seldom traveled path unless you have a
thing for the cozy scenery along the way.  The road here curves off to the
east as it heads for a pass between two hills.

weary travelers to rest before pressing onward.

End Of The Road?~
Here, the dirt road ends abrubtly at the edge of a gigantic crater.  It
seems there is no way to get to the other side, as hills on both side of
this crater block anyone from trying to go around it.  The slope ahead
looks like someone might be able to make it down ok, if they took it
slowly.  The crater is too dark to see if there is a similar slope on the
other side which could be used to continue forward.

Above A Gigantic Crater~
Good God look at the size of this hole.  The sheer size of this crater
is so great, the other end of the dirt road can barely be seen on the other
side.  Looking down, there is nothing but blackness as aparently this chasm
is incredibly deep as well. What could have made a hole this big?

Here, on the north side of the massive crater, the road continues onward
from the lip of the chasm and to the north just as it did coming up from
the south.  Along the entire length of this dirt road, this huge crater
which nobody knows how or when it was made, is the only thing of interest
along this scenic route.

Abrupt End~
The scenic dirt road through the countryside ends abruptly, and rather
unceremoniously at a giant limestone fighting ring.  With a tall, conicular
structure on each corner of the large arena, as well as a stretch of bare
dirt stretching around the perimeter of the ring, this arena used by
fighters world-wide sticks out like a sore thumb.  The only ways to go now
are onward to the ring, or back towards South City.

Near The Ring~
Standing here on the couple feet of bare dirt just before the arena
floor is where most fighters stand respectfully, waiting for their turn to
fight so they can watch the skills of others in the meantime.  This area of
dirt seems to go around the entire ring, making it the ideal observation
point.

South Side of the Ring~
Standing to one side of the massive limestone-tiled ring, it is still
aparent there is more than plenty of room to fight someone here.  At the
edge of the arena, the floor steps down to bare dirt which stretches
outward from the floor for a few feet.  Fighters waiting for their turn to
use the arena usually stand within this stretch of dirt as they watch
fighters in the ring go at it.  Beyond the stretch of dirt there is calm
grasslands, with the occasional hill and mountains in the far distance.

The Center of Cell's Tournament Ring~
Here at the center of the arena floor, the giant limestone ring spans
outward in every direction as a large square.  At each of the far corners,
there is a tall, thin, conicular structure made out of the same stone
material as the tiled arena floor.  Strong and sturdy, this fighting area
looks like it would stand up to most everything that could be put into it. 
Signs that this strength has been put to the test can be seen in the
occasional line of cracks and indentations made in the floor.

Even at the corner of the ring, there is still plenty of room for people

conicular structure of stone which sits at the very tip of the corner of
the tiled arena floor.  All around the edges of the arena floor, there is a
couple feet of bare dirt reaching outward where aparently the ground was
literally blown away.  Further beyond that, regular grassy lands can be
seen once again, along with the occasional hill and mountains in the much
further distance.

In The Air Above The Center Of Cell's Tournament Ring~
In the space of air directly above the center of the ring, it's apparent
there is far more room to fight than previously thought.  Fighting while
airborne provides it's own little set of difficulties, as the wind and
occasional feelings of weightlessness test your abilities of balance as
well as speed.  Be careful not to fall though, as an impact with the
limestone floor down below could smart rather painfully.

High Up In The Air Above The Center Of Cell's Tournament Ring~
Well up in the air above the center of the ring now, it is utterly
apparent how much available room there is for people to fight.  The open
air up here provides bountiful space where two fighters can peacably beat
the crap out of each other with little restraint.  Strong gusts of wind
however can provide intereference to those novice fighters that have yet to
truly master the art of flying.  Even then, the forces playing upon a
person at this height can dampen a fighter's perceptions as they move
around at incredible speeds.  Be careful not to get hit back down towards
the ground again.  A fall from this high up could be very, very painful. 
The mountains in the far distance can be seen rather clearly now from here.

High Up In the Air Above The Ring~
Well up in the air above one of the sides of the ring now, it is utterly
apparent how much available room there is for people to fight.  The open
air up here provides bountiful space where two fighters can peacably beat
the crap out of each other with little restraint.  Strong gusts of wind
however can provide intereference to those novice fighters that have yet to
truly master the art of flying.  Even then, the forces playing upon a
person at this height can dampen a fighter's perceptions as they move
around at incredible speeds.  Be careful not to get hit back down towards
the ground again.  A fall from this high up could be very, very painful. 
The mountains in the far distance can be seen rather clearly now from here.

Near The Ring~

floor is where most fighters stand respectfully, waiting for their turn to
fight so they can watch the skills of others in the meantime.  This area of

Aerial Shortcut To The Arena~
Some say the best path to a destination is to take the high road.  And,
as anyone knows, the highest road is through the air.  Soaring high up into
the air, the dirt road becomes somewhat of a thin line between the hills
down below.  With South City to the...well, to the south, the dirt road
spans onward to the north.  Only way to go now is flying onward to the
north, or landing again.

Soaring High Above The Countryside~
Contuing to fly along through the air at a casually fast speed, the
scenic value of the view from up here becomes quite apparent.  Clear blue
sky, except for the occasional puffy white cloud, green fields, hills, and
mountains as far as the eye can see.  Truly, this is some quite nice
scenery.  The only thing marring this picturesque landscape is a giant
chasm directly below.  Circular, this crater which seems to almost have no
bottom appears to have been created by some kind of enormous blast.  With
the mountains around to either side, it looks as if the road access was cut
off by it.  Good thing some people are smart enough to travel by air.

Mid-Air Near The Arena~
Shortly to the north, the arena is now visible as a small grey square. 
The other side of the dirt road can be seen leading up to it, then stopping
abruptly.  Coming closer and closer to the arena, it seems now would be a
good time go ahead and land down below.  Still a short distance away from
the arena yet, but then again walking never hurt anyone.

Falling Down Into The Crater~
WAAAAAAAAA!  Damn it's a long ways down.  Good thing some people are
able to fly.  It looks like a fall down into this crater could really hurt
once someone hit the bottom.  As dark as it is already, the light continues
to diminish deeper into the crater.

Bottom Of The Crater~
Here at the bottom of the deep and massive crater there is very little
light coming down from above.  From what can be made out, it looks possible
to climb back up the slope to the south.  However the northern side looks
far too steep to make it up.  Unless a person knows how to fly, it seems
the access north along the road has been cut off by whatever kind of blast
made this hole.

Before A Small Shack~
Here in front of the old, and long since abandoned shack, there is a
pitiful excuse of a front yard deteriorating from years of neglect.  Wooden
planters rotted and barely holding in the dead plants that rest within
them, this place has a rather pitiful look to it; as if to say "Please. 
Someone put me out of my misery." To complete this look, there is a little
dirt mound and a makeshift cross marking where someone's beloved pet was
laid to rest.  The front door of the shack lays slightly ajar, as it
appears to be a common resting place for travelers passing through the
area.

This Old House~
Good lord it reeks in here!  Rotting wood covered in mold from years of
exposure to the elements have caused an ungodly odor to linger within this
termite hotel.  The only thing adorning this single-roomed shack is
something that resembles a wooden dresser, and a foul looking mattress.  Oh
well.  At least this is a place to heal from the long walk.

Grassy Field Near The Ring~
Outside the band of dirt encircling the ring, there is nice, calm
grass-covered land.  However, the scenery once again finds itself distrubed
by a large, white news van that sports the giant logo '&RZ&W-&BT&Gv&Y! 
&g'.  The large side door to the van is ajar, and the occupants are nowhere
in sight.  Perhaps nobody would mind if someone rested inside?

Inside the news van, activity is at an all time high.  Lights blinking,
machines buzzing, and screens flickering as data is streaming in and out of
the mobile appendage of the Z-Tv News station at, well, at the pace of a
news station.  The entire van seems to be empty.  The front of the van can
be seen to the left, and the tv crew's sleeping quarters can be seen to the

a steering wheel, as well as a cold cup of coffee still sitting in it's

air-freshener in the shape of Hercule's head with a bigass stupid grin,
giving a little peace sign with one hand, dangles uselessly about.

Almost Up Near The Jetstream~
At this altitude, the ring is no longer visible down below.  The
landscape is similar to the view from an airplane, and with good reason as
airplanes can be seen flying acrost the skies in the distance.  The visual
clarity in all directions is almost limitless, as the horizon can be seen
any direction which is looked upon.  Lots of clouds clutter about the area
as well, dampening the high visibility.  Even though there is limitless
room to fight up here, it will be difficult to do so with the weather
conditions at this altitude.  Thinner air, gale-force winds, and the
chilling cold make for a hostile fighting environment.

clarity in all directions is almost limitless, as the horizon can be seen
any direction which is looked upon.  Lots of clouds clutter about the area
as well, dampening the high visibility.  Even though there is limitless
room to fight up here, it will be difficult to do so with the weather
conditions at this altitude.  Thinner air, gale-force winds, and the
chilling cold make for a hostile fighting environment.

The Jetstream~
This altitude is the limit for any fighter unable to survive in an
airless atmosphere.  Beyond this point is the stratosphere.  The air up
there is incredibly thin, and mostly comprised of nitrogen.  And that's
without even mentioning the extreme cold.  Of course, to even make it to
the stratosphere, one has to get past this jetstream.  Massively powerful
winds reaching into the several hundreds of miles per hour blow about
freely here.  Even someone able to fly is going to have great difficulty
manuevering any further upwards than here.  Fighting is impossible here.

Lower Stratosphere~
High above the jetstream now, and many miles above the ground, the wind
dies back down to an eery standstill.  At this extreme altitude, the sky is
a darker blue as there is less light up here than at ground level.  Also
noticable, is the lack of breathable air.  The temperature is subzero,
however anything surviving at this altitude probably doesn't feel cold
anyways.  All around there is just barren, lonely, and empty skies.

In The Stratosphere~
Countless miles upward still, the center of the stratosphere is as
lonely a place as it could possibly be.  The cloud cover far down below is
the only reminder of any civilization that exists now.  As the desolation
of outer space comes closer, the sky around continues to darken ever more. 
A seldom seen environment, even this barren place holds a very solemn form
of picturesque beauty.

Up, up, and farther up still and the stratosphere is still all around
yet.  Just when it looks like this region of atmosphere above the earth
could go on till eternity, the twinkling of stars begins to appear here and
there.  The sky is very deep shade of blue now as the edge of the
atmosphere is approaching.  The stars that can be seen now shatter the
hopeless depression one feels while traveling through the stratosphere.

Edge Of The Atmosphere~
The end of the Earth, as some call it, is the place that is all around
now.  The edge of the atmosphere that surrounds the earth turns the horizon
into a bright blue band with white at the edges.  Above, space is now
visible as clear as day. Below, all that can be made out now are continents
and clouds.  It's impossible to even conceive being able to see the
fighting ring down on the earth below.  In the heavens above, the countless
stars twinkle brightly like an ocean.  A great distance away, the small
grey object called the moon can barely be seen as light from the sun
reflects off of it's surface.  Space junk such as satellites and other
miscellaneous garbage looks as tiny specks floating around just above
the Earth.

Above The Earth~
Soaring out into the void for hundreds of miles, the Earth starts to
become a little more distant.  A little more distinct as a sphere rather
than something that dominates one's vision.  Tens of thousands of miles
ahead, some kind of cloud of debris seems to be floating about.  What seems
like many times more distant than that, is the moon.  An object of note now
would be the lack of any sound out here in space.  Apparently without any
air as a medium to travel through, sound waves are rendered useless.

Out In Space~
Flying for a few thousand more miles, a fact about this region of space
suddenly becomes apparent.  With no gravity pulling someone back towards
the earth now, as well as limitless room in any direction, the usefullness
of this region to fight is clear now.  Two fighters could seemingly fight
endlessly without restraint in such a vast space.  While it's impossible to
speak with sound out here, two people could always communicate with thought
instead.  However, there doesn't seem to be any places for the fighters to
rest afterwards.  Or maybe there's something in the big field of debris
several thousand miles ahead yet?

Frequent Flyer Miles?~
Covering vast distances spanning a couple thousand miles is alot easier
out here in space for people that fly, seeing as how there is no friction
out in the void of space.  Although it does take a bit of energy to slow
down again.  The debris field seemed rather small from a long distance
away, however, getting closer to it the debris field continues to grow in
size more and more.  And it's still a long distance off yet.

Coming seemingly out of nowhere, a large satellite whips by here; nearly
missing.  It's unknown how much junk there is floating around in space, but
it's surely apparent all this debris that circles the earth makes for a
quite dangerous hazzard.  The satellite continues floating off to the left,
and the giant debris field is still up ahead.

Silent ever still, the solemn loneliness of space rears it's head again.
Up ahead, the debris field can be seen quite clearly now.  There seems to
be some kind of wreckage of a large structure just floating uselessly in
space, with tons of space junk and debris hanging around the wreck as well.
The feeling of an empty wreck suddenly changes to that of a spacial
graveyard as the severed torso of some android drifts by.

A Closer Look~
The largest chunk of debris floating around in this field seems to be
some sort of spaceship.  Chunks of the craft, as well as large, car-sized
chunks of rock seem to indicate what fate may have befallen this vessel. 
How or when this spaceship was hit by some sort of asteroid, the debris is
now forever trapped in this region of space; held by the gravitational
pulls of the Earth and the Moon.  Within the cloud of debris, something
resembling a kind of door or hatch appears to be intact on a side of the
large structure.

An Airlock~
Here at an intact hatch set in the side of the vessel, the debris seems
to be repelled away from this pocket of space by something.  The door
itself shows slight signs of rust and age.  The spaceship must have been
floating out here for a long, long time.  But there's a problem.  The hatch
doesn't seem to have a handle anywhere.  The only thing that even seems to
be on the door are some strange markings of different colors, and what
looks like some kind of label with writing on it.  The label reads
"Paradox-1301 juela yldejydeuh cocdas.  Cyo ubah tuun du bnulaat ehdu dra

aparently spoke a wildy different language than english.  Unless someone
understood what this means, it seems further progress is impossible.

The door closes behind, and the chamber pressurizes.  However, the air
is still apparently unbreathable.  This small chamber is slightly dim as
one of the lights have been smashed out.  The interior of the ship so far
gives it an incredibly advanced feel as everthing that is still intact has
a precision-like feel to it.  More than likely, this ship did not originate
from Earth.  There is another hatch directly ahead that must lead into the
interrior of the ship.

By The Airlock - Second Deck~
A dank odor of stale air, rotting flesh, and spilled oil greet the nose
of anyone entering this place.  A thin layer of smoke drifts about near the
ceiling.  Twisted and mangled corpses, or parts of corpses, of androids,
icers, and other creatures somewhere inbetween are sprawled about here and
there.  Some on the floor, others crumpled over against the bulkheads of
this large passageway.  It seems whatever fate befell this ship, it
certainly wasn't a collision with an asteroid.  Or rather, not entirely. 
Somewhere distant, the faint clank of metal upon metal can be heard echoing
around as apparently someone or something is still alive and moving about
the vessel.

The air in this passageway has grown stale over the countless years this
ship has been drifting in space.  Bodies are strewn about rather
gruesomely; a reminder that something still might lurk around this ship.  A
once rather high-tech ship in it's time, it has been reduced to little more
than a metal crypt.  It would be wise not to spend too much time aboard

Intersection - Second Deck~
Here, the two direction passageway branches off with a third passageway
available to the south.  Down that passageway, it's slightly darker than
here, as a short circuit caused by damage makes the lights flicker and
spark.  Down that way, something in the bulkhead to the left resembles some
kind of door.  Just as things are seeming quiet again, the clanking sound
of metal upon metal can be heard echoing from afar.  Best not to stay in
any one place for too long.

Passageway - Second Deck~
The air in this passageway has grown stale over the countless years this
ship has been drifting in space.  Bodies are strewn about rather
gruesomely; a reminder that something still might lurk around this ship.  A
once rather high-tech ship in it's time, it has been reduced to little more
than a metal crypt.  It would be wise not to spend too much time aboard
this craft.

Intersection - Second Deck~
Here, the two direction passageway branches off with a third passageway
available to the south.  Down that passageway, it's slightly darker than
here, as a short circuit caused by damage makes the lights flicker and
spark.  Down that way, something in the bulkhead to the left resembles some
kind of door.  Just as things are seeming quiet again, the clanking sound
of metal upon metal can be heard echoing from afar.  Best not to stay in
any one place for too long.

On the south side of the passageway, there is another handle-less door
set in the bulkhead.  With all the carnage and lack of life around this
ship so far, it seems odd to assume, but is there sound coming from
something behind the door?  It seems like there is.  A knock on the door
however gets no response.  The door itself has more strange colored
markings, and a message scratched into the metal which reads "Bynytuq

Scorch marks, splattered blood and other unidentifiable fluids, massive
dents, and holes in the bulkheads show a rather vicious battle must have
taken place here.  The two large doubledoors to the west that close off the
entrance to the ship's main elevator have been badly damaged, unable to
close completely anymore.  A small panel above the doors which must have
served as the voice system for the doors now showers down sparks every now
and then; useless.  It seems now the elevator doors can just be opened and
closed at will.

Refuge~
Once some kind of mini cargo bay, boxes and such have been cleared out
to create a makeshift living quarters.  A bed in one corner appears to have
been made out of a few crates with some blankets thrown over them.  A
flickering capsule television sitting upon another small hill of boxes
seems to be the occupant's form of entertainment.  Facing the door now from
across the room is a mecha-icer.  Signs of the wear and tear of battle
showing on his body, it seems on more than one occasion this fighter has
taken near-mortal wounds; having to replace lost body parts with mechanical
ones.  The icer seems to be waiting for some kind of response.

Repair Bay - Second Deck~
The walls of this giant room must be sound supressing, because there is
a great deal of noise here unlike the dread quiet of the rest of the ship. 
Piles of scrap android parts litter about near large tables where large
machines are going back and forth over different tables repairing and
creating various devices.  A few tables here are empty and unattended
however.  There is more noise going on in either direction, indicating
there must be more work areas than just this one.

The third deck seems to be the most intact part of the ship.  Lighting,
electrical systems, all seem to be working.  However, the life support
systems still seem to be inoperable.  Perhaps they were purposefully
disabled.  Whatever the case, the alarm systems on this level are going
berserk.  Access further west to the bridge has been cut off entirely by
massive blast doors.  Red lights are blaring all throughout the
passageways, giving them a crimson shade.  Every now and then some kind of
alert message goes over the intercom system in a strange language.

Bridge of the Paradox 1301~
Out of the frying pan and into the fire, as the saying goes.  The bridge
of the Paradox 1301 has been turned into a hellish nightmare.  Countless
corpses of human-like beings and androids alike have been maliciously
mutilated and left crumpled around the room in piles of torn flesh and
metal.  Blood is everywhere.  On the walls, the ceiling, the floor, and
various computer equipment that must have been used to steer the ship when
it was still operable.  The culprit of the tragedy that befell this
spaceship stands in the center of the bridge.  Whether it's the twisted
look of sinister mirth framing his face, his narrowed, glowing crimson
eyes, or the blood dripping off the surface of his mechanical body that
possesses a technology from another dimension, it's certainly clear this
android embodies all that is evil.

Passageway - Third Deck~
This deck of the ship is the most eerie of them all.  Mainly, this is
because there is no blood.  No corpses.  Anywhere else on the ship is like
a tomb, except here there is nothing.  Either this section was never
infiltrated by whatever force befell the ship, or whatever did come through
here just atomized anyone in it's path.  The only other perplexing detail
of the area is the fact that the alarm systems on this deck are going
literally berserk; emergency lighting casting a red glow upon the
passageways.  Although it seems safe in this area, it's unknown what
security counter-measures might be in place here.

Intersection - Third Deck~
The level of advancement in the surroundings continues to increase
further into this area.  Besides the passageways leading off to the
northwest and southwest, there is a widening passageway to the east.  In
that direction, the ceiling continues to rise upward as it goes on, the
walls distancing themselves from one another as well.  Whatever is over in
that direction, is big.  Really big.  To the west, there is a somewhat
large door leading to the medical bay.  However, this closed door has no
handles or buttons as well.  A sign on the door reads "Ica juela lussyht
satelym du ahdan." 

An odd flickering can be seen out of the corner of your eye, almost as if
there's a rift in the fabric of space.

Passageway - Third Deck~
This deck of the ship is the most eerie of them all.  Mainly, this is
because there is no blood.  No corpses.  Anywhere else on the ship is like
a tomb, except here there is nothing.  Either this section was never
infiltrated by whatever force befell the ship, or whatever did come through
here just atomized anyone in it's path.  The only other perplexing detail
of the area is the fact that the alarm systems on this deck are going
literally berserk; emergency lighting casting a red glow upon the
passageways.  Although it seems safe in this area, it's unknown what
security counter-measures might be in place here.

Intersection - Third Deck~
The ceiling in this area is as high as a cathedral.  To the north and
south, two massive rooms appear as gigantic metallic coccoons.  In each
room, three doors appear to lead off into seperate rooms of their own. 
Some kind of steam is leaking from pipes along the walls and trailing down
to the floor; aparently keeping the rooms at a controlled lower
temperature.  It's a wonder what a place of this size is used for.

Subspace Manipulation Training Facility~
One of the true marvels of the technological advancement of the people
that built this ship is now evident in this section.  In different rooms
here, powerful computers and equipment are able to manipulate the flow of
sub-space and time to create artificial realities for fighters to train in.
However, it seems the rooms are all locked off to prevent over-usage.  Not
going to be able to get in without the proper access keycard.

The Antarctic - Subspace~
This place looks, feels, and even smells like real life.  However, the
door leading back into the ship sticking out like a sore thumb spoils the
experience.  As far as the eye can see there is nothing but ice, snow, and
white mountains.  The wind whips about fiercely bringing with it the
stinging chill of subzero temperatures.  A hostile environment, yes, but a
good place to fight as well.

A Busy City - Subspace~
This place looks, feels, and even smells like real life.  However, the
door leading back into the ship sticking out like a sore thumb spoils the
experience.  Cars and aircars alike zip along the busy streets of the city,
inbetween massive skycrapers. People walking along on the sidewalks don't
even seem to notice the door back to the ship which is just standing out in
the middle of the street.  Although it would seem evil of a person to fight
in a place like this, a person has to remember that none of this is real
and neither are the people.

Tropical Paradise - Subspace~
This place looks, feels, and even smells like real life.  However, the
door leading back into the ship sticking out like a sore thumb spoils the
experience.  This reality is similar to something you'd find on any
tropical island on the Earth. Palm trees, exotic species of birds, animals,
and plants as well as a humid climate of just about 80-85 degrees. 
Overhead, the sky is a pristine clear blue except for a few tiny white
clouds far in the distance.  Looking out towards the horizon and in all
directions, it's apparent this place is just a lone island surrounded by an
endless ocean.

Planet Namek - Subspace~
This place looks, feels, and even smells like real life.  However, the
door leading back into the ship sticking out like a sore thumb spoils the
experience.  It's unclear exactly how or why this location was chosen, but
this subspace room has been fashioned into the ominous namekian landscape. 
Rocky islands and landmasses surrounded by green-tinted seas and rivers,
blanketed in grass, with strange trees that are straight up and down with
poofy little blue-ish colored balls of leaves adorning the tops frame the
view in all directions.  Every here and there, there are odd white
structures with round, blue windows.  In what looks like some kind of
fields or gardens, namekian workers tend to growing some strange plant.

Medical Center - Third Deck~
Rather than a fully automated healing facility, this area looks more
like some kind of hive.  Dozens of identical, large metal chambers line the
walls all across the room in a long, continuous row.  Fighters making use
of the ships training facilities often come back here to heal up again;
many of them severely thrashed.  However, ever since the crew of this ship
was seemingly exterminated, almost nobody ever comes by here anymore.  A
terminal by one of the bulkheads which was once used to dispence access
cards to the ships training rooms still looks like it might be operational.

Passageway - First Deck~
One of the most damaged and unused decks of the ship, various metal
crates and boxes float through the passageway slowly.  It seems the
artificial gravity is inoperable on this level.  Well, that's just utterly
aparent as the upper torso of somebody's corpse floats past.  The lighting
flickers as it struggles to work right, however in some areas the lighting
has ended entirely.  Echoing down through the passages the sound of twisted
laughter can be heard every so often, as well as metal upon metal clanking
of something moving about.

Once again, further progress has been cut off down this passageway.  But
this time, it's simply because there is nothing left to travel down. 
Ahead, the passageway is simply gone.  Through the wreckage and torn
bulkhead surrounding the edges, open space and the debris field around the
ship can be seen clearly once more.  There is nothing left in this

Rather than being caused by any natural occurance, it seems the
passageway here has been closed off purposefully.  Countless tons of
wreckage blocks any further travel down this passageway.  Standing
defiantly in the way, a short, bizzare, little mushroom-shaped android
stands here.  Laughing in a mad, high pitched tone, this creation seems to
be part of or assiciated with whatever attacked the ship.  Most noticable,
there is what looks like some kind of symbol on the android's forehead. A
strange-looking letter "E".

small wobbly spheres of blood and other chemicals.

Outside The Cargo Storage Bay - First Deck~
It would appear the massive double-doors cutting off access to the ships
main cargo storage bay have taken quite a beating.  However, these doors
dented outward still seem to be able to open and close well enough to keep
just anyone from opening them without using the proper voice command. 
Whoever or whatever opened them by force must have possessed incredible
strength.  The long-since dried remains of someones head splattered all
over one of the doors is covering up part of the sign on the door, making
it slightly unreadable at sections.  What can be made out on the sign reads
"...uela...lus...ht......cdunyka du ahd...."

Cargo Storage Bay - First Deck~
A rather massive, high-ceiling room serves as the ship's main cargo
storage bay.  Of what hasn't been smashed or torn apart to an
unrecognizable degree, metallic boxes and crates are huddled over in
corners of the room where they probably used to lay uselessly; when there
was still gravity in this section.  Where there used to be a large section
of deck in the center of the room there is now merely a giant gaping hole
in the hull of the ship; space, stars, and debris surrounding the ship
framing the view out the hole.  An open doorway to the northwest leads to
another section of the cargo bay.

Cargo Storage Bay - First Deck~
This section of cargo bay seperated off from the other is considerably
smaller.  With no cargo anywhere in sight, it's a wonder what the point of
this room was at all.  The northern bulkhead has caved in somewhat, leaving
a large pile of wreckage taking up part of the space in the cargo bay.  On
the south side of the room, there is another doorway leading into a small,
dark room.  It seems like there is something large in the room, but it
can't be seen; only heard, as a low multi-toned voice seems to murmur
something unintelligible.  Standing infront of the doorway, a vicious
looking android seems to be standing guard.  Body armor painted in a scheme
of golds, silver, and brown, this killing machine seems to have features
partly of some kind of cross between a man and a lion.  Standing upright on
two legs with the body of a humanoid, however the feet and hands have been
replaced with monofilament-sharp claws and talons.  The face resembles that
of a lion, with the pronounced snout and steely eyes.  Jagged, spiked,
golden metalic appendages seem to resemble hair, but look just as sharp as
it's claws.  A strange looking "E" symbol on it's forehead declares the
android's allegiance.  As it stands guard, a low, menacing growl rumbles
from it's lips.

A Morgue - First Deck~
A room once used for special cargo, it is little more than a twisted
morgue.  Half eaten corpse float about the room, as well as countless small
spheres of floating blood and entrails.  The bulkheads of the room have
been overrun by some kind of organic material that laces about like veins
in a way.  At the center of the room, a giant creature reaching over ten
feet in height stands amidst the shattered remains of some kind of
container.  On the head of this abomination, a small little face seems to
be making some kind of bizarre murmuring noise.  The organic material in
the room seems to react to it; pulsing in rhythem.  Upon sighting a new
victem, the large creature seems to roar in a twisted and hoarse tone.

Intersection - Third Deck~
The ceiling in this area is as high as a cathedral.  To the north and
south, two massive rooms appear as gigantic metalic coccoons.  In each
room, three doors appear to lead off into seperate rooms of their own. 
Some kind of steam is leaking from pipes along the walls and trailing down
to the floor; aparently keeping the rooms at a controlled lower
temperature.  It's a wonder what a place of this size is used for. 

An odd shimmering can be seen at the edge of vision, as if some sort of
hidden portal may be flickering in and out of existence.

1999 AD "Apocalypse" - Subspace~
The future Earth, or at least that's what this reality seems to be. 
Whether its the real dimension, or another dimension cannot be certainly
decided upon.  However, everything is quite real.  In the distance, massive
metropolian cities covered by gigantic transparent domes can be seen here
and there; testament to this time's level of technological advancement. 
Just as the view seems too perfect to behold, the ground begins to tremble
violently.  About a fourth a mile ahead, the ground cracks and splits; a
seething fiery glow pouring from the lacerations in the Earth's crust. 
Suddenly, there is a roaring blast of sound as the the cracks in the ground
explode upward; massive chunks of solid and molten rock floating upward
into the as if someone had willed them to.  And then, from within the
massive chasm, a single being began to rise from within it.  A
mind-bogglingly large mountain of rigid spikes of an unknown material. 
With an Earth shattering wail from the eye concealed within the beak at the
base of it's front, the great Lavos creeped up onto the land.  The spikes
of it's body suddenly started to glow brightly, before firing searing beams
of crimson light up into the sky, which then rained down upon the land;
decimating everything.  Something must be done to stop this evil creature,
or the world will surely end here and now.  The apocalypse has come.

peacefully.  On the north side of the courtyard, a single brown wooden door
stands there with nothing seemingly on the other side of it.  To the west,
a short cobblestone bridge leads over to another small courtyard with
strange lights on the floor.  In the corner, a small trashcan sits
uselessly; a small twinkling light shining from within.

The hidden door from the subspace training facility leads into this

technology, this place is not a fabricated dimension, but an actual place
at the 'end of time'.  Supposedly when time runs out in the universe,
everything is supposed to return to nothingness.  Spanning all around until
infinity, there is dark void.  The other matter that exists now is a short
cobblestone street.  Behind, the street leads back to the door into the
ship.  Ahead, it leads to a small cobblestone courtyard.  Some odd etchings
can barely be made out on one of the cobblestones.
