Buildings here seem to look different than a lot of others around town.
These look older as if they have been around for awhile.  They are still
kept up quite well.  Many people seem to be hanging out around here.
Either talking on cell phones or just hanging out with friends.

can see a few pieces of furniture and a couple of tables in this room.  It
seems quite simple and ordinary for someone who is always trying to save
the world.  Upon closer inspection of the room, you can see a very old
ancestral sword that is in a golden sheath.  Next to it on a wall you can
see a full Saiya-jin body Armor also glowing gold.  Other trinkets and
items from what looks like different battles cover the walls of his room.
You look around to see all of the other things that involve this curious
Saiya-jin's life.

fireplace in a corner of the room, and there is a desk sitting beside it.
Atop of the desk is the most bad-ass AleinWare computer you could ever

there is a dishwasher below the sink.

various articles of clothing are strewn across the floor.  A decent
portrait of Flare is hung upon the wall, he is wearing a muscle shirt and
dog tags are hung from his neck.  On his table, there is a thick tablet of
paper with many scouter frequencies and phone numbers scrawled on it. There
is a picture of Tarfen taped to the mirror which is autgraphed, "To Flare -

A simple room, about twelve feet to a side, crammed more or less to
capacity with variouse belongings.  A small stove, microwave, and
refrigerator stand in one corner, beside a small desk with an old computer.
In the opposite corner, a tiny, unmade twin-size bed stands.  Laundry and
various pieces of electronic equipment are scattered across the floor, and
a set of old saiyan battle armor is hung over the back of a chair before
the computer desk.  It looks very lived-in, the owner obviously not the

&RThe Center of the Magnificent Shadow Realm..~
&z The Shadow Realm holds its last standing clasp around this very room,
it spreads its horror, and essentially its nightmare of darkness.  The
temperature is hotter then ever in the shadow realm, a sense of both cold
and heat interact, leaving the shadow realm most uncomfortable.  However,
those who are evil seem to be of comfort, such as Enkarn the Great, the
lord of Destruction.  Enkarn has learned to manipulate the shadow realm
according to his needs, manipulation so complex as changing the actual
color base of the shadow realm.  Ancient evil fills this room with its very
presence, you can touch it amongst your sensors...

could he be doing???  The alley ends to the northwest, and to the southeast.

Capsule Shop~
Capsules, capsules, and more capsules!  There doesn't seem to be
anything other than capsules here.  This place must have every single
capsule ever created.

Armor Shop~
Talk about selection!  This place has enough armor and protective gear
to last a life time.  They've got simple kevlar shirts to strange looking
stuff that you couldn't even begin to imagine where it came from.

Equipment Store~
This is a well furnished shop for all your adventuring needs.  Capsules
line the walls with tiny labels underneath each one describing what
it is.  Jackets, boots, helmets and just about everything you might
ever need seems to be in stock here.

Busted Stuff Repair Shop~
This is a nice clean room, if you don't count all the scattered junk
every where.  There are broken TV sets, radios and computers amongst
countless other pieces of junk.  There doesn't seem to be a single
thing here that isn't broken.

The Morgue~
This is a very cold room.  Medical equipment, tables and lots of
weird creepy things cover this room.  It looks as if there are
bodies underneath some cloths on a few of the tables.
